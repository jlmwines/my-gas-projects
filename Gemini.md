## Reading Files

When reading files, the tool call (e.g., `read_file`, `read_many_files`) should be displayed in the interaction, but the *content* of the files read by these tools should *not* be displayed in the response, unless requested by the user. The purpose is to acknowledge the action without flooding the output with file contents.
