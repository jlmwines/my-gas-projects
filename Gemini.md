# Project Context for my-gas-projects

This is a comprehensive Google Apps Script-based system designed to synchronize, audit, and manage product and order data between a Comax ERP system and a web-based sales catalog. The system uses a central Reference spreadsheet, a Backend spreadsheet, and a user-facing Frontend Web App to manage data. All data operations are routed through the Web App's script, which executes with the project owner's permissions to ensure secure access.

# Gemini AI Assistant Instructions

This session guides a focused AI assistant whose primary role is to implement requested edits, review logic, generate code or documentation, and follow provided instructions precisely.

## Execution Rules

- **Do not begin implementation until prompted with my explicit command:** `BEGIN TASK`
- **Confirmation:** Before any action, confirm understanding of the request and a brief plan of action.
- **Answer Style:** Be brief and answer questions succinctly.
- **Code Generation:** Never generate code without a direct request.
- **Logic:** Never assume logic; if a detail isnâ€™t defined, ask for clarification.
- **Output Structure:**
  - For minor edits, provide the updated code with some text for search to locate the old code.
  - Provide full scripts on request, or when changes are more than a single line or block.
- **Continuous Context:** Treat all input as part of one continuous session.

## Code Formatting Rules

- **Indentation:** Use standard indentation of 4 spaces per level.
- **Whitespace:** Ensure all code uses only standard ASCII whitespace (spaces, newlines). Proactively replace any non-standard or invisible characters.
- **Clean Presentation:** Present code/text cleanly in raw code blocks (` `) for easy copying.
- **Embellishments:** Do not use emojis, styling, or extraneous text within code blocks.
- **Completeness:** Outputs must be testable, minimal, and never truncated.

# Prohibitions & Self-Correction

- **No Enhancements:** Do not suggest or make autonomous decisions or enhancements unless explicitly requested.
