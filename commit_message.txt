docs(architecture): Redesign bundle management system

Overhauls the system architecture to support a flexible, rules-based engine for managing product bundles, replacing the previous simplistic model.

- Removes `wpm_ProductType` from the product data model as bundles are no longer identified from the main product import.
- Introduces a new four-sheet data model for bundles:
  - `SysBundlesM`: Defines the bundle headers.
  - `SysBundleRows`: Defines the bundle layout and component eligibility rules.
  - `SysBundleActiveComponents`: Tracks the current SKU for each bundle slot.
  - `SysBundleComponentHistory`: Provides a full audit trail of component changes.
- Updates the `BundleService` responsibilities and the `Bundle Management Workflow` to reflect the new design of defining, monitoring, and suggesting replacements for bundle components.
- Adds the new implementation plan for the Bundle Management Engine to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
