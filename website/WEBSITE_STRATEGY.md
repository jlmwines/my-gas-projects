# JLM Website Strategy & Content Direction

Reference document for website copy, blog posts, and brand communications.

## Core Positioning

**Primary Message:** "You don't need to be a wine expert to drink like one. We've done the vetting for you."

**The Trust Statement:** "You aren't just buying wine; you're buying our palate. We put our reputation on every packing slip."

**Communication Style:** Every email or social post should feel like a recommendation from a friend who happens to be a pro.

---

## Occasion-Based Shopping

Customers don't shop by acidity or intensity scores. They shop by occasion. Frame categories around real life:

- The Shabbat Table
- Gifts They'll Actually Open
- Mid-Week Pizza Night
- Something Special

## About Us: Positioning as the Customer's Filter

### The Story
> "We started JLM because we were tired of buying bottles that sounded great on the label but fell flat in the glass."

### The USP
> "You aren't just buying wine; you're buying our palate. We put our reputation on every packing slip."

## A Note from Evyatar

> If you've ever felt overwhelmed in a wine aisle, you aren't alone. Between the labels and the jargon, it's hard to know what you're actually getting.
>
> I've spent my life studying wine—from winemaking at Soreq to the WSET program—but my real joy isn't in the technical details. It's in the moment a customer comes back to my shop in Katamon and says, "That was exactly what I was looking for."
>
> My goal for this website is the same as it is in my shop: to be an honest guide in a complicated world. I'm not here to sell you the most expensive bottle; I'm here to make sure the bottle you buy makes you happy.

## How We Choose Our Selection

> The Israeli wine scene is growing fast, and every season brings something new. We don't just stock every label we can find. Instead, our team takes the time to sample as many wines as possible from wineries across the country.

**Our process:**

1. **Taste:** We sit down with each bottle and consider the quality and the "story" it tells
2. **Compare:** We ask, "Is this the best version of this wine at this price point?"
3. **Select:** We only keep the bottles that we would be proud to serve at our own table

## FAQ Framing

Answer the "Why" behind suggestions. Keep it short.

| Question | Answer Direction |
|----------|------------------|
| "How do you choose your wines?" | The vetting process—tasting, comparing, selecting |
| "Why do you use scales?" | To show the thinking behind our recommendations |
| "What if I don't like a wine?" | The Second Sip Guarantee |
| "Do I need to be an expert?" | "No. That's our job. You just need a glass." |

## Blog Approach

Blog posts should be **Advice Columns**, not **Lessons**.

- Frame as "here's how we think about it" not "here's what you need to know"
- Build trust through showing the process, not teaching wine vocabulary
- Monthly spotlights on what we're drinking and why

---

## Key Phrases

- "The Second Sip Rule" — if you want another sip, it's a good wine
- "Your collection, curated before you even browse"
- "You're buying our palate"
- "We put our reputation on every packing slip"
- "An honest guide in a complicated world"

---

## Cultural Notes

- **No "ritual"** — has religious connotations in Israel. Use "tasting session" or "tasting"
- **No "cheap wine"** — use "lower-priced" or "everyday value"
- Wine terminology should feel accessible, never intimidating
- Never negative about any wine, brand, or competitor

---

## Homepage Treatment

See `WEBSITE_UPDATE_PLAN.md` for the updated homepage layout specification.

See `MARKET_CONTEXT.md` for customer segments, competitor analysis, and Israeli consumer behavior.

### What to Avoid on Homepage

- More than 3 slider slides (attention drops)
- "Shop Now" as sole CTA (too generic—use "Browse Wines" or "Find Your Bottle")
- Long text blocks (save depth for blog and About page)
- Wine jargon in navigation
