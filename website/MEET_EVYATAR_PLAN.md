### 1. The Story

> "We started JLM because we were tired of buying bottles that sounded great on the label but fell flat in the glass."

Short origin story - why JLM exists, the problem it solves.

### 2. The USP

> "You aren't just buying wine; you're buying our palate. We put our reputation on every packing slip."

The core differentiator - Evyatar IS the product.

### 3. A Note from Evyatar

> If you've ever felt overwhelmed in a wine aisle, you aren't alone. Between the labels and the jargon, it's hard to know what you're actually getting.
>
> I've spent my life studying wine—from winemaking at Soreq to the WSET program—but my real joy isn't in the technical details. It's in the moment a customer comes back to my shop in Katamon and says, "That was exactly what I was looking for."
>
> My goal for this website is the same as it is in my shop: to be an honest guide in a complicated world. I'm not here to sell you the most expensive bottle; I'm here to make sure the bottle you buy makes you happy.

Personal message establishing:
- Credentials (Soreq winemaking, WSET)
- Philosophy (honest guide, not upseller)
- Human connection (Katamon shop, repeat customers)

### 4. How We Choose Our Selection

> The Israeli wine scene is growing fast, and every season brings something new. We don't just stock every label we can find. Instead, our team takes the time to sample as many wines as possible from wineries across the country.

**Our process:**

1. **Taste:** We sit down with each bottle and consider the quality and the "story" it tells
2. **Compare:** We ask, "Is this the best version of this wine at this price point?"
3. **Select:** We only keep the bottles that we would be proud to serve at our own table
