## Notes for Translation

- Maintain first-person voice in Hebrew
- "Evyatar" stays as name (not translated)
- Avoid formal Hebrew — conversational register ("אני" not impersonal constructions)
- "Wine Talk" → "שיחות יין" or keep English
- Keep sentences short — works better in both languages

## Voice Strategy

### When to Use First-Person ("I")

Evyatar speaks directly when it's a personal promise or invitation:

| Context | Voice | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Homepage hero | First-person | "I taste the wines" |
| Bundles headings | First-person | "I recommend. You choose." |
| Trust Builder | First-person | "How I Choose" |
| Exit popup | First-person | "I can help" |
| WhatsApp/Email signup | First-person | "from Evyatar" |
| Checkout optin | First-person | "I send notes..." |
| Packing slip note | First-person | "A note from Evyatar" |
| **All video content** | First-person | Evyatar on camera, speaking directly |

### When "We" is Fine

Team voice for educational/informational content:

| Context | Voice | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Packages | "We" | "We choose. You save." — team curates |
| Decision Helper | "We" | "We choose the wines" — team voice |
| Blog posts | "We" | Team contributes, Evyatar is chief but not sole author |
| Email body copy | "We" | Can frame as "from Evyatar" but use "we" in body |
| FAQ answers | "We" | Business policies, team answers |
| Product descriptions | Neutral/We | Factual information |

### The Logic

- **Video:** Evyatar is on camera — first-person is natural
- **Homepage:** Introducing Evyatar — first-person creates connection
- **Direct invitations:** Personal ask — first-person feels warmer
- **Packages/Team work:** "We" represents the team's curation
- **Blog content:** Educational — "we" represents the team's knowledge
- **Policies/facts:** Neutral — doesn't need a personal voice

## Copy Principles (Reference)

1. **Evyatar speaks directly** — first person for personal promises
2. **"We" for team work** — packages, curation, blog content
3. **No jargon** — if a customer wouldn't say it, don't write it
4. **Trust over education** — reassuring, not teaching
5. **Short sentences** — respect the reader's time
6. **Anti-snob** — never talk down, never show off
7. **Consistent voice** — website matches video matches email matches WhatsApp
