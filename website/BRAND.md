# JLM Wines — Brand Identity

**Site:** jlmwines.com
**Type:** Wine retail / e-commerce
**Platform:** WooCommerce, bilingual (Hebrew + English)

## Personality

Warm, inviting, anti-snob. This is the friend who knows wine but never makes you feel dumb for not knowing. Personal, conversational, never condescending. Earnest — genuinely wants to help people find wine they'll enjoy. Never negative about competitors.

## Visual Identity

**Colors:**
- Primary: _(to be defined — wine-adjacent but not cliched burgundy-on-everything)_
- Accent: _(to be defined — warm, inviting)_
- Background: _(warm neutrals, not clinical white)_
- Text: _(readable, not overly dark)_

**Typography:**
- Headings: _(to be defined — personality, warmth)_
- Body: _(to be defined — readable, not sterile)_
- Currently using Open Sans (10 variants, needs optimization to 2-3)

**Photography/imagery:**
- Canva AI generated: impressionist oil painting style, warm natural lighting, no text
- Featured images match this style consistently
- Not stock photography, not flat design illustrations

**Layout patterns:**
- Product pages: clean WooCommerce
- Blog: two-column (content left, images/cards right), stacks on mobile
- Content-forward design — the words matter as much as the visuals

## What This Site Is NOT

- Not a luxury/exclusive wine shop
- Not a generic e-commerce template
- Not similar to VaadAi or AliyahNet
- Not pretentious, never talks down

## Differentiation from Other Projects

| | JLM Wines | VaadAi | AliyahNet |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Mood | Warm, personal | Professional, clean | Helpful, authoritative |

## Reference Style

Modern boutique wine shops that feel personal, not corporate. Think small-batch, neighborhood wine store with good taste — not a supermarket wine aisle and not a pretentious tasting room.
