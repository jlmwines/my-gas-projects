High intensity (4 of 5) - High-intensity wines are bold and expressive, with pronounced aromas and concentrated flavors. They deliver a more impactful wine experience. These wines stand up well to richer, more flavorful foods, often cutting through richness or complementing strong spices.

Moderate complexity (3 of 5) - Wines of moderate complexity show a noticeable interplay of several aromas and flavors, and perhaps a developing character on the palate. The experience is more engaging, with layers that unfold.

Harmonizing (congruent) pairings bring together wines and foods that share similar flavor components, creating a harmonious experience where the tastes reinforce each other. Harmonize with:
 • Rich flavors: Salmon and similar fish, red meats, fattier foods, and many hard cheeses.
 • Intense flavors: Heavily seasoned and spicy dishes, and foods with strong, more noticeable flavors.

Contrasting (complimentary) pairings bring together wines and foods with few shared flavor components. This creates a dynamic balance, where the different tastes complement and enhance each other. Contrast with:
 • Mild flavors: Soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, pasta in a light sauce.

After removing the foil or wax from the bottle, gently insert the extended prong between the cork and the bottleneck. While moving downwards, insert the shorter prong until both prongs are fully inserted. A gentle wiggle motion might be needed to help insert the Cork Puller. Once the prongs are secured between the cork and the glass, extract the cork by pulling in a rotating motion.

The Cork Puller’s 2-in-1 design allows you to open crown capped bottles such as soft drinks and beer. Its stainless steel handle and non-stick prongs make the Cork Puller a durable product, suitable for prolonged use.

The Lever Corkscrew is easy to operate and requires little strength to open a bottle of wine without damaging the cork. The corkscrew's highly efficient system enables any wine cork – irrespective of length or material – to be extracted in a continuous, smooth, vertical motion.

"Meshek Achiya Picual Olive Oil",57071,"Meshek Achiya Picual Olive Oil is an excellent virgin olive oil characterized by a wonderful fruity aroma and fresh flavors of green olives, produced from the Picual variety grown in the Meshek Achiya groves. Picual oil has a delicate and unique herbaceous taste that adds a twist to every dish, a gentle bitterness and low acidity, which is why it is suitable for seasoning fresh salads, cheeses and Mediterranean dishes. The outstanding feature of Picual olive oil is its perfect compatibility for frying. The Picual variety contains a high percentage of antioxidants and oleic acid, and has a very low pyroxoid level. Thanks to these two advantages, it is resistant to decomposition in heat, which is why it is the most recommended for frying and cooking.

The origin of the Picual olive is in Andalusia in Spain. It is considered of the highest quality due to its extremely low acidity and high stability, and its antioxidants keep you healthy. It is a particularly stable oil, which retains its taste and properties even during prolonged storage.

Excellent virgin olive oil, maximum acidity up to 0.5%, without any additives and without preservatives. 1 Liter bottle.

"Meshek Achiya Syrian Olive Oil",57074,"Meshek Achiya Syrian Olive Oil is an excellent choice for people who like authentic and strong olive oil. The oil is extracted from Syrian olives growing in the plantation of Ahya's farm in the Shiloh Valley, at an altitude of 750 meters above sea level.

Syrian olive oil is the perfect match for hummus, white bread, salads and foods in which you want to feel the olive oil well. It is even suitable for desserts. The oil is also resistant to frying and is very suitable for baking and long-cooking foods, to which it contributes excellent aromas.

The Syrian olive oil is rich in a green fruity aroma, it is endowed with dominant flavors of green apple and almonds and is considered to have moderate levels of pungency and bitterness. The oil is rich in phenols (natural flavors) and oleic acid, which makes it a healthy oil due to the fact that it contains a large amount of antioxidants.

The Syrian variety, which comes from Tyre in Lebanon (and not from Syria, as many tend to think), has been growing in Israel for thousands of years. Apparently this is the oldest variety of olives in the world and the most common in Israel. Its resistance to dry climate conditions makes the Syrian variety particularly suitable for growing in the Middle East, and miraculously, and although it does not need a lot of water, it is among the group of varieties with the highest oil content in the fruit!

The process of harvesting the olives begins at the beginning of October when half of the olives are still green. Like all the olive oils of Meshek Achiya, Syrian olive oil is also produced from olives that are carefully selected and become a pure oil in a cold pressing process that preserves its taste, aroma and natural color.

Excellent virgin olive oil, maximum acidity up to 0.5%, without any additives and without preservatives. 1 Liter bottle.

Moderate complexity (3 of 5) - Wines of moderate complexity show a noticeable interplay of several aromas and flavors, and perhaps a developing character on the palate. The experience is more engaging, with layers that unfold.

Harmonizing (congruent) pairings bring together wines and foods that share similar flavor components, creating a harmonious experience where the tastes reinforce each other. Harmonize with:
 • Mild flavors: Soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, pasta in a light sauce.

Contrasting (complimentary) pairings bring together wines and foods with few shared flavor components. This creates a dynamic balance, where the different tastes complement and enhance each other. Contrast with:
 • Rich flavors: Salmon and similar fish, red meats, fattier foods, and many hard cheeses.

High intensity (4 of 5) - High-intensity wines are bold and expressive, with pronounced aromas and concentrated flavors. They deliver a more impactful wine experience. These wines stand up well to richer, more flavorful foods, often cutting through richness or complementing strong spices.

Very High complexity (5 of 5) - These wines are exceptionally complex, displaying a multitude of aromas and flavors that can be both primary (from the grape), secondary (from winemaking), and tertiary (from aging). The experience is profound and captivating, often revealing new dimensions with each sip.

Harmonizing (congruent) pairings bring together wines and foods that share similar flavor components, creating a harmonious experience where the tastes reinforce each other. Harmonize with:
 • Rich flavors: Salmon and similar fish, red meats, fattier foods, and many hard cheeses.
 • Intense flavors: Heavily seasoned and spicy dishes, and foods with strong, more noticeable flavors.

Contrasting (complimentary) pairings bring together wines and foods with few shared flavor components. This creates a dynamic balance, where the different tastes complement and enhance each other. Contrast with:
 • Mild flavors: Soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, pasta in a light sauce.

Milder and lighter cheeses such as Mozzarella, Haloumi, or Gouda pair nicely with white and rosé wines that have lower acidity. The combination allows delicate wine flavors to harmonize with light cheese flavors. Wines with higher acidity might make an interesting counterpoint to these milder cheese flavors.

Strongly flavored cheeses (Brie, Camembert, and other rich, creamy soft cheeses) pair well with the sharper sensations of higher acidity wines. The acid of the wine and richness of the cheese bring fresh sensations in turn, each highlighting the other.

Picual oil has a delicate and unique herbaceous taste that adds a twist to every dish, a gentle bitterness and low acidity, which is why it is suitable for seasoning fresh salads, cheeses and Mediterranean dishes. The outstanding feature of Picual olive oil is its perfect compatibility for frying. The Picual variety contains a high percentage of antioxidants and oleic acid, and has a very low pyroxoid level. Thanks to these two advantages, it is resistant to decomposition in heat, which is why it is the most recommended for frying and cooking.

The origin of the Picual olive is in Andalusia in Spain. It is considered of the highest quality due to its extremely low acidity and high stability, and its antioxidants keep you healthy. It is a particularly stable oil, which retains its taste and properties even during prolonged storage.

Nibbling is almost guaranteed, so try some amazing olive oil on your best sides and salads, and for dipping fresh bread. Any of the white remaining will be a nice lead-in with these foods, especially with popular Middle-Eastern dishes and senses heightened by the tempting cooking aromas.

The first red should be ready to pour about the time the food comes to the table. This milder red provides a pleasant transition and fits well with the smoky and savory foods coming off the grill.

This is where the serious eating often takes place, and the conversation gets a bit neglected while attention is on the plates and glasses.

"Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew",61860,"The Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew is our twist on a classic wine accessory. The Twister has a spacer for extra stability and grip.

After removing the foil from your bottle, place the corkscrew on top of the wine bottle. While maintaining a firm grip, press the sides against the bottle. The rubber strips make sure the bottle opener is secure and won’t turn while you drive the corkscrew into the cork. When the cork is extracted, remove the corkscrew from the bottle. You are ready to serve.

The Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew extracts all wine corks (irrespective of length) in a continuous, smooth and vertical motion. The wired corkscrew easily slides into all corks, both synthetic and natural, making opening a wine bottle a quick and easy task.

Its sleek and ergonomic design makes the Vacu Vin Twister Corkscrew a household staple to open all corked wine bottles.

Low complexity (2 of 5) - Low-complexity wines offer a bit of nuance, perhaps with more discernible aromas or tastes. The experience remains relatively simple but with a touch more depth than the very basic wines.

Low acidity (2 of 5) - Lower acidity wines feel softer and rounder on the palate, lacking that sharp, tangy edge. They can feel smoother and sometimes richer. When paired with food, they tend to complement rather than contrast, often working well with richer, less acidic dishes.

Harmonizing (congruent) pairings bring together wines and foods that share similar flavor components, creating a harmonious experience where the tastes reinforce each other. Harmonize with:
 • Mild flavors: Soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, pasta in a light sauce.

Contrasting (complimentary) pairings bring together wines and foods with few shared flavor components. This creates a dynamic balance, where the different tastes complement and enhance each other. Contrast with:
 • Rich flavors: Salmon and similar fish, red meats, fattier foods, and many hard cheeses.
 • Intense flavors: Heavily seasoned and spicy dishes, and foods with strong, more noticeable flavors.

Low complexity (2 of 5) - Low-complexity wines offer a bit of nuance, perhaps with more discernible aromas or tastes. The experience remains relatively simple but with a touch more depth than the very basic wines.

Very low acidity (1 of 5) - Lower acidity wines feel softer and rounder on the palate, lacking that sharp, tangy edge. They can feel smoother and sometimes richer. When paired with food, they tend to complement rather than contrast, often working well with richer, less acidic dishes.

Harmonizing (congruent) pairings bring together wines and foods that share similar flavor components, creating a harmonious experience where the tastes reinforce each other.
• Sweet flavors: Sweet flavors: Desserts and pastries, as well as foods prepared with sweet sauces, glazes, or sweet ingredients.

Contrasting (complimentary) pairings bring together wines and foods with few shared flavor components. This creates a dynamic balance, where the different tastes complement and enhance each other.
• Intense flavors: Intense flavors: Heavily seasoned and spicy dishes, and foods with strong, more noticeable flavors.
• Rich flavors: Rich flavors: Salmon and similar fish, red meats, fattier foods, and many hard cheeses.
• Mild flavors: Mild flavors: Soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, pasta in a light sauce.","Gently sweet and fresh.",publish,"2025-09-08 18:03:04",7290108620603,0,45,,no,no,,yes,,,,,"https://jlmwines.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zion-V.T.S-Rose-Semi-Dry.png ! alt : Zion V.T.S Rosé Semi-Dry ! title : Zion V.T.S Rosé Semi-Dry ! desc :  ! caption : ",https://jlmwines.com/product/zion-v-t-s-rose-semi-dry/,en,,simple,outofstock,"Rosé|Semi-Dry|Under ₪60",,"Zion V.T.S Rosé Semi-Dry - bright red fruit aromas with a hint of vanilla with a pleasant fresh finish that balances the sweetness.","Zion V.T.S Rosé Semi-Dry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,2|1|0,,2,1|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,Zion,0|1|0,
