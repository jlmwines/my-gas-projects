# JLM Wines — Current Status

**Updated:** 2026-02-18 (migrated from jlmops/SESSION_SUMMARY.md)

## Next Action

- Build `CampaignService.getTargetSegment()` for segment export
- Export segments for review (2025 customers, comeback targets, subscribers)
- Start small comeback campaign testing
- Research PDF generation for Year in Wine

## Current State

- **Sync workflow:** Stable. 12-state machine (Comax ↔ Sheets ↔ WooCommerce). Imports, exports, validation all working.
- **CRM enrichment:** Complete. 548 contacts enriched with dual-language preferences (categories, wineries, grapes, kashrut). Activity backfill working.
- **Campaign system:** Planned (`jlmops/plans/CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`), not yet built. Key decisions made: welcome offer NIS 50 off 399, Tuesday evening sends, 7-14 day attribution window.
- **Import system:** Fixed Dec 2025 — CSV filter, validation rule fix, quarantine diagnostics.
- **Admin UI:** Contact preferences display, activity ribbon icons.

## Known Issues

1. Monitor bundle additions for stale data recurrence
2. Consider auto-cleanup of rows below data range during upsert

## Blocked / Deferred

- Year in Wine PDF — needs PDF generation research
- Gift recipient campaigns — lowest priority, wait
- VIP recognition + referral program — after campaigns launch

## Session History

- **2025-12-25:** Import system fixes (CSV filter, validation rule, quarantine diagnostics). Hebrew translation import working (747 rows). Quarantine file preservation + detailed error messages.
