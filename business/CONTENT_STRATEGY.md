# JLM Wines: Content Strategy

This document defines the brand voice, content approach, and guiding principles for all JLM Wines communications.

---

## Brand Positioning

**One-line:** We do the work so you don't have to. No jargon, no snobbery, just good wine delivered.

### Who We Are

- **The anti-snob.** Wine without pretension.
- **Curators, not salespeople.** We taste everything. We reject what doesn't meet the bar.
- **Service-first.** Your experience matters more than our margin.
- **The opposite of the big retailer** who pushes whatever the winery needs to dump.

### Who We Are NOT

- Educators building a wine curriculum
- Sommeliers showing off vocabulary
- A discount shop racing to the bottom

---

## Our Customer

**Not "wine lovers."** Just people who drink wine.

They:
- Enjoy wine as part of life (like good coffee or a meal out)
- Want convenience—it shows up, it's good
- Want consistency—no more "this one's not what I expected"
- Don't want to learn wine vocabulary
- Don't want to feel stupid or talked down to

**Their unspoken question:** "Can I trust you to pick wine I'll actually like?"

**Our answer:** "Yes. We've done the homework. You just drink the wine."

## The Owner's Voice

All content should reflect the owner's tone:

- **Exceedingly polite.** Never says anything negative about a brand, winery, wine, or grape.
- **Earnest and upbeat.** Genuinely enthusiastic about helping.
- **Service-dedicated.** Your satisfaction is the goal, always.
- **Plain-spoken.** No jargon, no showing off.

The "anti-snob" positioning shows through *how* we talk, not *what* we say about others. The contrast with big retailers is felt, not stated.

---

## Content Purpose

Content exists to build **trust**, not to educate.

Every piece answers: "Why should I trust you to pick my wine?"

The answer comes through:
- Showing our process (the 10 AM tasting ritual, the rejections)
- Demonstrating care (we notice what you might not)
- Being helpful without being condescending
- Making wine feel approachable, not intimidating

---

## The Sensory Framework

We use an Audio (Music) + Visual (Art) metaphor system to describe wine characteristics.

**Important:** This is an internal tool for consistency—not something customers need to learn.

### Purpose
- Helps JLM describe wines consistently across all content
- Makes product copy relatable without jargon
- Gives staff a shared vocabulary

### Usage
- Use metaphors to *clarify*, not to dominate
- Customers should never feel they need to "learn" our system
- The metaphors appear naturally in descriptions, not as a framework to teach

### The Three Characteristics

| Characteristic | What It Measures | Low | High |
|----------------|------------------|-----|------|
| **Intensity** | Attention/role | Background, undemanding | Spotlight, commanding |
| **Complexity** | Number of flavors | One clear taste | Layers that unfold |
| **Acidity** | Brightness/zing | Smooth, round, soft | Crisp, mouth-watering, electric |

## Content Types & Approach

### Blog Posts

**Purpose:** Trust-building. Show expertise without lecturing.

**Tone:** Friendly conversation, not a lesson. "Here's how we think about it" not "Here's what you need to know."

**Structure for each topic:**
1. Hook (relatable problem or question)
2. Our perspective (simple, clear, helpful)
3. How this helps you (practical takeaway)
4. Optional: Video embed

### Video Scripts

Each blog post should have an accompanying video that:
- Can stand alone as a YouTube playlist item
- Works embedded in the blog post
- Exists in two formats:
  - **Short (under 60s):** Social-first (Reels/TikTok/Shorts)
  - **Long (2-5 min):** YouTube explainer with depth

**Video tone:** Same as written—warm, clear, zero pretension.

### FAQ

**Purpose:** Answer real questions simply.

**Approach:**
- Questions phrased as customers actually ask them
- Answers are direct and practical
- No opportunity to show off knowledge—just help

### Product Descriptions

**Purpose:** Help customers know if they'll like it.

**Approach:**
- Plain language
- Sensory framework used subtly (not "Intensity: 4" but "bold and full")
- "You'll like this if..." recommendations

### Navigation & Homepage

**Purpose:** Get people to what they want, fast.

**Approach:**
- Minimal clicks
- Clear categories
- No wine jargon in nav labels

## Content Inventory

### Core Topic Areas

These are the foundational concepts we communicate about:

| Topic | What It Covers | Primary Goal |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **What is a Good Wine** | The "second sip" rule, trust your palate | Permission to like what you like |
| **Intensity** | Light vs. bold, when to choose each | Help match wine to moment |
| **Complexity** | Simple vs. layered, no judgment | Explain without intimidating |
| **Acidity** | The "zing" factor in whites/rosés | Practical pairing help |
| **Pairing** | Harmony vs. contrast, four food categories | Make dinner decisions easy |
| **Context** | Weather, guests, occasion | Confidence in choosing |
| **How We Choose** | The tasting process, rejections | Build trust in curation |
| **Price vs. Quality** | What you're paying for | Justify value, reduce anxiety |
| **Handling & Storage** | Temperature, decanting, saving | Practical help after purchase |
| **Reds Guide** | Overview for red wines | Entry point for category |
| **Whites Guide** | Overview for whites/rosés | Entry point for category |
