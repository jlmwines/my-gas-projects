## Brand Voice Quick Reference

When working on anything customer-facing, remember:

- **Friendly, personal, never talks down**
- **Anti-snob** — wine without pretension
- **Customer:** People who drink wine (not "wine lovers"), want convenience and consistency
- **Owner's tone:** Polite, earnest, upbeat, service-dedicated, never negative about competitors
