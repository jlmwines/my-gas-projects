Product Detail Submission & Review
Project Status as of: Friday, August 1, 2025
1. Frontend Submission & Review Workflow
[STATUS: COMPLETE ✅]
The entire user-facing feature for submitting product detail edits is complete, tested, and working as intended.
Submission: A user opens the product detail editor from the sidebar, makes changes, and submits them for review using a native confirmation dialog.
Backend Processing: The _server_submitProductDetails function correctly updates the TaskQ status to "Review" and upserts a complete, clean record into the DetailsS staging sheet.
Automatic UI Refresh: The frontend sidebar automatically detects that the submission is complete and refreshes the product task list, providing a seamless experience for the user to continue their work without manual intervention.
2. Backend Admin Review - Load & Review
[STATUS: COMPLETE ✅]
The first phase of the backend admin workflow is complete.
Load for Review: The loadProductDetailReviews function correctly identifies all pending product detail tasks.
Generate Review Sheet: It successfully generates a Product Detail Review sheet populated with all necessary data for the admin.
Rich Previews: The sheet includes richly formatted preview columns for both English and Hebrew. These previews are generated by server-side logic that mirrors the frontend preview, ensuring the admin sees exactly what the user intended. The layout includes:
Approve Checkbox
SKU
Product Name
Short Description
English Preview (Fully formatted)
Hebrew Preview (Fully formatted)
תיאור קצר (Hebrew Short Description)
3. Backend Admin Review - Process Approvals
[STATUS: PLANNED 📝]
This is the final planned step for this feature. We will create a new function, processProductDetailApprovals, which will be triggered by a button or menu item.
Action: The script will scan the Product Detail Review sheet for all rows where the "Approve" checkbox is checked.
For each approved item, it will:
Merge Data: Find the matching SKU in the master DetailsM sheet and overwrite its data with the approved version from DetailsS.
Generate Export Data: Create the final, formatted rich description text for both English and Hebrew and place it in a designated export sheet or file.
Update Task: Change the task's status in TaskQ from "Review" to "Closed".
Clean Up: Delete the processed records from the DetailsS staging sheet and the Product Detail Review sheet.
