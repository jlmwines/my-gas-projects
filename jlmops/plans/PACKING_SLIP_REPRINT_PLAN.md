# Packing Slip Reprint Control

## Problem

When an order is edited after its packing slip is printed (while still on-hold), the printed slip becomes stale. The manager needs a way to reprint with updated data, but reprints should be rare and intentional - not offered for every printed order.

## Known weakness driving this (noted 2026-06-02)

**Not implemented** (status checklist below is all unchecked; code runs only the simple `sol_PackingStatus` Ready→Printed model — none of the planned fields/states exist). The gap surfaced in production: the `task.order.packing_available` singleton (de-duped, entityId `PACKING`, `due_pattern: immediate`) is the *only* signal of "orders available to print," and it closes only when `PrintService` prints everything down to 0 `Ready`. That worked until recently — slips got printed to zero and the task closed. When a `Ready` order lingers unprinted, the task stays open and its frozen creation-day due date ages into dashboard "overdue" — misleading, since it's a standing indicator, not a deadline.

**Correction direction (agreed 2026-06-02):** combine **(1)** this reprint/mutability lifecycle with **(2)** a **task-independent** way to determine "how many orders are really available for print" — availability derived from order/packing state (Ready / reprint-eligible per the state machine), *not* inferred from the presence of a singleton task. The task, if kept at all, becomes a thin notification over that state rather than the source of truth; that also removes the misleading-overdue symptom. (Related: do NOT blanket-suppress "overdue" styling on all system tasks — inventory counts / comax validations may have real deadlines; only this packing indicator is the clear non-deadline case.)

## Key Insight

- **Mutable orders (on-hold):** Can be edited, packing slip might become stale after print
- **Immutable orders (processing/completed):** Cannot be edited, packing slip data is final
- **Reprint only needed if:** Printed while mutable, might have been edited before becoming immutable

## Solution

Track packing slip state through a progression that coordinates printing with order sync. Offer reprint only when meaningful (order was printed while mutable and is still in reprint window).

## State Machine

### States

| State | Meaning | Cache Action |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `Ineligible` | pending, cancelled, failed, trash | No cache |
| `Ready` | Eligible, not yet printed | Keep cache |
| `PrintedMutable` | Printed while on-hold | Refresh on sync |
| `ReprintWindow` | Was mutable at print, now immutable, window open | Refresh on sync |
| `Closed` | Done, no reprint available | Clean up cache |
| `Refunded` | Permanent close, cannot reopen | Clean up cache |

### Fields Required

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `sol_PackingSlipState` | string | Current state |
| `sol_ImmutableSince` | timestamp | When order became immutable |
| `sol_SyncsSinceImmutable` | integer | Count of syncs since immutable |

### Window Close Condition

**Both must be true:**
- `sol_SyncsSinceImmutable >= 2`
- Days since `sol_ImmutableSince >= 2`

## UI Changes

### Packing Slip Card (Top)
- Shows only `Ready` orders (unprinted)
- No change to current behavior for first prints

### Open Orders Card (Below)
- Shows on-hold and processing orders
- **Reprint button/checkbox** appears for orders in:
  - `PrintedMutable`
  - `ReprintWindow`
- **No reprint** for: `Ready`, `Closed`, `Refunded`, `Ineligible`

### Reprint Flow
1. Manager sees order in Open Orders list
2. Clicks "Reprint" (only visible if applicable)
3. Order appears in Packing Slip card for printing
4. After print: if immutable → Closed; if still mutable → stays PrintedMutable

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Modify

1. **SysOrdLog schema** - Add new fields
2. **OrderService.js** - Update `processStagedOrders()` for state transitions
3. **PackingSlipService.js** - Coordinate cache refresh with state
4. **PrintService.js** - Update state on print
5. **ManagerOrdersView.html** - Add reprint UI to Open Orders
6. **WebAppOrders.js** - Expose reprint eligibility to UI

### Cache Refresh Logic

```javascript
// During sync, for each order:
if (state === 'PrintedMutable' || state === 'ReprintWindow') {
  // Refresh cache from WebOrdItemsM
  refreshPackingCache(orderId);
}
```

### Window Check Logic

```javascript
function isWindowClosed(order) {
  if (!order.sol_ImmutableSince) return false;
  const daysSinceImmutable = (now - order.sol_ImmutableSince) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return order.sol_SyncsSinceImmutable >= 2 && daysSinceImmutable >= 2;
}
```

---

## Open Questions

1. Should `sol_SyncsSinceImmutable` reset if order is cancelled and reopened?
   - **Proposed:** Yes, fresh start on reopen

2. What if sync runs multiple times per day?
   - **Handled:** Syncs count up, but 2-day minimum still required

3. Should we show "days remaining" in reprint window UI?
   - **Proposed:** No, keep UI simple - just show reprint button or not
