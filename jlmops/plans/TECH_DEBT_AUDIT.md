# jlmops Tech Debt Audit

**Created:** 2026-05-11
**Updated:** 2026-05-11 — first cheap-wins pass complete (see §6 "Done" subsection).
**Method:** Survey pass — scan-and-list, no deep verification. Each finding needs triage before any fix.
**Scope:** dead/one-use code, obsolete dev UI controls, code-compliance drift, plan-doc accuracy, data integrity gaps.
**Out of scope:** the existing data-integrity backlog already captured in `.claude/bugs.md` (timestamp audit, CRM cleanup, count-task audit, decanting zero, SKU mgmt test verifications) — referenced from §5 but not re-discovered.

**Severity legend:** S=safe-to-delete after one quick check · M=needs scope decision · L=lower priority / cosmetic.

---

## 1. Dead / One-Use Code

### 1.1 Orphan HTML views (not in `WebApp.getView` viewMap, no other references) — **DONE 2026-05-11**
- ~~`Dashboard.html`~~ (168 lines) — DELETED.
- ~~`ManagerDashboardView.html`~~ (69 lines) — DELETED.
- ~~`AdminDashboardView.html`~~ (130 lines) — DELETED. Stray comment reference in `ManagerProductsView.html:6` reworded ("Bootstrap from Dashboard.html" → "Bootstrap loaded by AppView.html"); no functional `AdminDashboardView` reference existed.
- ~~`DisplayOrdersView.html`~~ (33 lines) — DELETED.

### 1.2 Placeholder views that ship in production but do nothing — **DONE 2026-05-11**
- ~~`ComaxView.html`~~ (13 lines) — DELETED + removed from `WebApp.getView` viewMap.
- ~~`WebView.html`~~ (14 lines) — DELETED + removed from `WebApp.getView` viewMap.

Pending: `clasp push` to retire from the deployed source tree.

### 1.3 `SetupMigrate.js` (442 lines)
- One-time migration from a legacy spreadsheet (hardcoded ID `1YLqfcX0zqXrRbJccduaWgcnY6qLjL39Y5bbD4Lu5tXc`) to JLMops master sheets. Already executed. See §7 for full legacy-retirement context.

### 1.4 Retired-feature dead code (already known)
- War-support detection — flagged in `.claude/bugs.md` CRM-cleanup bundle. Cross-referenced here for completeness.

### 1.5 ~~Stale state-machine branch in `SyncStateService.js`~~ — **WITHDRAWN 2026-05-11**
- Finding was incorrect. `PUSHING_WEB_INVENTORY` IS declared in STATES (`SyncStateService.js:30`) — earlier grep filtered it out due to a too-narrow regex. The transition `WAITING_WEB_CONFIRM → PUSHING_WEB_INVENTORY` is valid; `PUSHING_WEB_INVENTORY → ['COMPLETE', 'FAILED']` is its outgoing edge. No fix needed.

### 1.6 Drive-import paths possibly orphaned after WC REST API pull
- STATUS.md (Current State) says: "Full Woo REST API pull (products + translations + orders) deployed Feb 2026. 'API Pull' button runs entire pipeline." But `OrchestratorService.js`, `ProductService.js`, `OrderService.js`, `ProductImportService.js`, `HousekeepingService.js` still reference `import.drive.web_orders` / `import.drive.web_products_en` extensively (~25 sites).
- `import.drive.comax_products` is legitimately still drive-based (Comax CSV drop).
- **CLOSED 2026-05-12** — user confirms `web_orders` and `web_products_en` drive paths are intended fallback (kept in case the REST API pull is unavailable). No removal action. Future sessions: do not re-surface this as cleanup.

### 1.7 Test files in production deploy (`*Test.js` + `TestData.js` + `TestRunner.js`)
- `OrderServiceTest.js`, `ProductServiceTest.js`, `ComaxAdapterTest.js`, `WebAdapterTest.js`, `TestData.js`, `TestRunner.js` — ~1,343 lines total. Wired into `DevelopmentView.html` via `runUnitTests()` button.
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` last updated 2025-12-08 (Phase 0/0A); unclear if any of these tests still pass against the current service shapes.
- **M — decide: (a) keep + groom (re-run, fix breakages, treat as living regression suite), or (b) remove from deploy (move to a `tests/` folder excluded from `clasp push`). Default recommendation: (b), since GAS lacks a real test runner and the suite hasn't been touched in 5 months.**

---

## 2. Obsolete Dev UI Controls

### 2.1 `DevelopmentView.html` audience + obsolete controls
- **Audience CLOSED 2026-05-12** — user confirms Development view is admin-only in practice (audit's "no role gate" finding was incorrect or has been gated elsewhere).
- **Developer Wishlist textarea DELETED 2026-05-12** — card markup, `loadWishlist`/`saveWishlist` JS, init `setTimeout`, plus backend `getDevWishlistContent` + `saveDevWishlistContent` in `WebApp.js`. Hard-coded spreadsheet ID `1ESV9fJHKykPzy3kS88S9FWF46YodTuJ35O8MvfVModM` ("Wishlist" sheet, cell A2) no longer referenced.
- **Run Unit Tests button KEPT** — admin-run unit tests have value (per user 2026-05-12, see §1.7 disposition).
- The panel still exposes maintenance actions (Rebuild SysConfig, Protect Headers, Validate Schema, Daily Housekeeping, Run Unit Tests, Import CRM Data, Validate CRM, Correct Data, Refresh Contacts, Enrich Contacts, Run Intelligence). All admin-appropriate.

### 2.2 ~~`AdminSyncView.html` carries commented-out "new sync widget" scaffolding~~ — **DONE 2026-05-11**
- Commented HTML block + JS stub removed. View now loads only the active V2 widget.

### 2.3 Run Unit Tests button (see §1.7)
- If §1.7 decision is "remove from deploy," also remove this button from `DevelopmentView.html`.

---

## 3. Code-Compliance Drift

### 3.1 ~~`CODING_STANDARDS.md` §9–10 list stale stage names~~ — **DONE 2026-05-11**
- §10 rewritten as a 14-row table over the actual STATES (`SyncStateService.js:15-33`), including `PUSHING_WEB_INVENTORY` and the kind taxonomy (`processing` / `user action` / `terminal` / `resting`).
- §9 step mapping reworked against the current stages; widget code remains the definitive source for step-to-stage UI logic.

### 3.2 `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §11 job-types list may be incomplete
- Lists `import.drive.web_orders`, `import.drive.web_products_en`, `import.drive.comax_products`, `job.periodic.validation.master`, `export.web.inventory`. Need to verify against `OrchestratorService.finalizeJobCompletion()` switch — there's also a Mailchimp pull, campaign pull, and post-sync bundle health trigger that may be wired in other ways.
- **M — reconcile after §1.6 decision (drive vs API).**

### 3.3 Placeholder views use `btn btn-primary`
- `ComaxView.html:9` and `WebView.html:9-10` use `btn btn-primary` — violates `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §3 + `jlmops/CLAUDE.md` button rule. Resolves automatically if §1.2 is acted on (delete the files).

### 3.4 `setConfig` key-shape inconsistency
- All callers correctly use the 3-arg signature (the 2-arg bug was fixed 2026-05-05). However the second argument varies:
  - Topic-level keys: `setConfig('system.brurya.last_update', 'value', ts)` — settingName carries the full path, key is the generic `'value'`.
  - Topic + field: `setConfig('woo.api', 'products_last_pull', ts)` — settingName is the topic, key is the field.
- Both work, but inconsistency makes it harder to scan SysConfig and harder to predeclare rows. Worth documenting the preferred shape and migrating one direction.
- **L — pick one shape, document it in `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §2 or a new section, normalize over time.**

### 3.5 Hardcoded spreadsheet ID in `SetupMigrate.js` (see §1.3)

---

## 4. Plan-Doc Accuracy

(Survey-level only — each entry needs a freshness pass.)

- **`MASTER_PLAN.md`** — "Updated: 2026-02-16" header. STATUS.md is the actual living source of truth for current priorities. **L — either refresh, retire (point header to STATUS.md), or merge useful long-view content into STRATEGIC_PLAN.md.**
- **`TESTING_GUIDE.md`** — "Last Updated: 2025-12-08," references Phase 0/0A. **M — tied to §1.7 decision (keep or retire the test suite).**
- ~~**`CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`** vs **`CAMPAIGN_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — two campaign plans now coexist.~~ **PARTIAL 2026-05-11** — status header added to `CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` pointing at `CAMPAIGN_ARCHITECTURE.md` as the implementation and clarifying the older doc's role (strategic context: welcome offer, send cadence, attribution). Open question (deferred): should the strategic content merge into `STRATEGIC_PLAN.md` and the older doc retire?
- ~~**`KPI_SUMMARY_TAB.md`** — STATUS.md flags this as DEFERRED/parked (Claude's pitch, not user's). **S — add a status header making this explicit so future sessions don't re-surface it as ready-to-build.**~~ **DONE 2026-05-11** — status header rewritten to "DEFERRED / parked (2026-05-07)" with rationale.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` + `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` + `WORKFLOWS.md`** — no dated headers; size/scope makes them hard to skim for drift. **M — each needs a targeted "what's accurate / what's drifted" pass against the current code, especially the sync workflow section and the data-model overview which may now reference renamed states or missing services (e.g., `MarketingCampaignService`, `MailchimpService`, `WooProductPullService`, `WooOrderPullService` postdate these docs).**
- **`PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`** — dashboard performance plan; post-V2-dashboard freshness unknown. **L — quick verdict pass.**
- **Stale theme-prep docs surfaced 2026-05-07 cleanup** (RANKMATH_WPML_AUDIT, STAGING_AUDIT, THEME_FOUNDATIONS, etc.) live in `plans/` at the project root, not in `jlmops/plans/`, so out of scope for this audit. Noted for the next portfolio cleanup pass.

## 5. Data Integrity Gaps

All major items here are already on `.claude/bugs.md` — cross-referenced, not re-listed:

- CRM cleanup bundle (`sc_IsCore` defaulting overwrites import, Archive missing `CouponItems`, historical row corruption, dead war-support code, gift-detection rule) — `bugs.md:21-26`.
- Timestamp + date format audit — `bugs.md:28`.
- On-demand count-task creation audit (dedupe, assignment correctness, data-vs-count task split) — `bugs.md:30`.
- Decanting field treats 0 as empty — `bugs.md:32`.
- Pending SKU management test verifications (Vendor SKU Update + Trim Safety, deployed 2026-02-19, never tested) — `STATUS.md:51-54`.

**New from this audit:**

### 5.1 Sync stuck-state recovery for failed Comax import
- `.claude/bugs.md:19` notes this is deferred ("rare case"). Still worth a small fix — currently a corrected file upload after a failed import doesn't recover state, requiring manual intervention.
- **L — add explicit state-reset path in `_checkAndAdvanceSyncState` for `FAILED → WAITING_COMAX_IMPORT` retry.**

### 5.2 SysConfig predeclared-row hygiene
- Memory `feedback_read_arch_before_writing.md` records the pattern: one predeclared row per topic, `scf_P02` overwritten in place. The 2026-05-05 sweep fixed three writers but didn't verify all `setConfig` call sites predeclare their rows in `config/system.json`.
- **M — walk every `setConfig(...)` call (12 sites identified) and confirm a matching row exists in `config/system.json`. Currently uncertain whether `system.brurya.last_update`, `system.mailchimp.subscribers_last_update`, `system.mailchimp.campaigns_last_update`, `woo.api → products_last_pull` are all predeclared.**

### 5.3 SyncState `PUSHING_WEB_INVENTORY` reference (see §1.5)
- If this is a live state used at runtime but missing from the STATES object, transition validation may be silently passing through unguarded paths.

## 6. Triage Recommendation

**Done in first cheap-wins pass (2026-05-11):**
- §1.1, §1.2, §2.2, §3.1, §4 KPI_SUMMARY_TAB header, §4 CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM_PLAN header

**Needs a decision before touching:**
- §1.3 `SetupMigrate.js` — addressed by §7.1 (proposed deletion)
- §1.6 Drive-vs-API import paths — biggest scope question; affects ~25 code sites
- §1.7 Test files in deploy — keep + groom, or remove from deploy
- §2.1 DevelopmentView gating — what's the audience for which buttons
- §5.2 SysConfig predeclared-row walk
- §7.3 SetupSheets.js consolidation — proposed shape ready, awaiting OK

**Existing backlog (already tracked):**
- All of §5 except 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 — defer to existing bugs.md entries

**Lower priority:**
- §3.4 setConfig key-shape normalization
- §4 ARCHITECTURE/IMPLEMENTATION/WORKFLOWS freshness pass
- §5.1 stuck Comax import recovery

## 7. Legacy GAS Project Retirement

**Scope:** code in jlmops that was attached to the predecessor Google Apps Script project (cutover months ago). Not "drive-vs-API" inside jlmops; not "legacy WC import." Specifically: migration scripts, comparison-against-old-system code, and setup helpers that exist only because of the migration era.

### 7.1 ~~`SetupMigrate.js` — fully orphan, safe to delete~~ — **DONE 2026-05-11**

Both functions (`populateInitialOrderData`, `populateInitialProductData`) read from the legacy spreadsheet `1YLqfcX0zqXrRbJccduaWgcnY6qLjL39Y5bbD4Lu5tXc` (legacy sheets: `OrdersM`, `OrderLog`, `DetailsM`, `WeHe`, `ComaxM`, `WebM`, `Audit`) and write to the jlmops master sheets. Confirmed before delete: zero callers, legacy spreadsheet ID appears nowhere else in the codebase, legacy `Audit` sheet was the inline-consumed "comparison" data from the one-time migration.

**Result:** entire file deleted (442 lines). Pending `clasp push` to retire from deploy.

### 7.2 No ongoing legacy-comparison service exists

Search across jlmops for any reader of the legacy spreadsheet or comparison logic against the old system came up clean apart from `SetupMigrate.js`. The "comparison/validation" the user recalled was performed inline during the one-time migration, not as a separate service. `SysProductAudit` (which appears in inventory code) is unrelated — it's the live physical-count audit sheet used by `InventoryManagementService`, not legacy reconciliation.

### 7.3 ~~`SetupSheets.js` — 38 `create*Headers()` functions → consolidate to one generic~~ — **DONE 2026-05-11**

**Result:** SetupSheets.js reduced from 1,317 lines to 199 lines (~85% shrinkage).

- 38 per-sheet `create*Headers()` functions + 3 hand-coded master orchestrators (`createJlmopsSystemSheets`, `createCrmSheets`, `createLookupSheets`) → 1 `syncHeaders(sheetName, {preserveExtraColumns})` + 1 `syncAllHeaders()` that discovers sheets from `schema.data.*` config keys.
- `setupMarketingSheets()` retained as a named helper (pairs with `seedMarketingCampaigns()`) but reshaped to call `syncHeaders` internally.
- `protectAllSheetHeaders()` + `protectAllSheetHeadersFromUI()` preserved unchanged — they were already config-driven.
- `SysProductAudit`'s preserve-extra-columns behavior preserved via the `preserveExtraColumns` option, applied automatically by `syncAllHeaders()` for that sheet.
- `DriveApp.getFilesByName('JLMops_Data').next()` (CODING_STANDARDS §5 violation) now used in zero places — replaced with `SheetAccessor.getDataSpreadsheet()`.
- Two error-message strings in `ContactAnalysisService.js` updated from `createSysLkpCitiesHeaders()` → `syncHeaders('SysLkp_Cities')`.

Pending `clasp push` to retire the old functions from deploy.

**Original analysis below for reference:**

What the functions actually do (verified against `createWebXltSHeaders` body):

1. Open `JLMops_Data` and get/create the named sheet (create branch hasn't fired since cutover).
2. Clear row 1 entirely.
3. Rewrite row 1 from `schema.data.<SheetName>` config.

In other words: **they're header-sync helpers, misnamed "create."** Data rows are never touched. Only situation they'd legitimately run is after a schema change in `config/schemas.json` — a rare event now that the data model is stable.

**Callers:** only the master orchestrators `createJlmopsSystemSheets()`, `createCrmSheets()`, `setupMarketingSheets()`, `createLookupSheets()` — themselves only run from the Apps Script editor at setup/schema-change time. No UI button. No runtime path. The two `ContactAnalysisService.js` mentions are error-message strings (developer hints), not invocations.

**Proposed shape:**

```javascript
function syncHeaders(sheetName) {
  const allConfig = ConfigService.getAllConfig();
  const schema = allConfig[`schema.data.${sheetName}`];
  if (!schema || !schema.headers) {
    throw new Error(`Schema for '${sheetName}' not found. Run rebuildSysConfigFromSource first.`);
  }
  const spreadsheet = SheetAccessor.getDataSpreadsheet(); // per CODING_STANDARDS §5
  let sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(sheetName);
  if (!sheet) sheet = spreadsheet.insertSheet(sheetName);
  const headers = schema.headers.split(',');
  const maxCols = sheet.getMaxColumns();
  if (maxCols > 0) sheet.getRange(1, 1, 1, maxCols).clearContent().setFontWeight('normal');
  sheet.getRange(1, 1, 1, headers.length).setValues([headers]).setFontWeight('bold');
}

function syncAllHeaders() {
  const allConfig = ConfigService.getAllConfig();
  Object.keys(allConfig)
    .filter(k => k.startsWith('schema.data.'))
    .forEach(k => syncHeaders(k.replace('schema.data.', '')));
}
```

**Impact:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 38 per-sheet `create*Headers()` functions (~900 lines, near-identical bodies) | 1 `syncHeaders(sheetName)` (~30 lines) |
| 4 master orchestrators (`createJlmopsSystemSheets`, `createCrmSheets`, `setupMarketingSheets`, `createLookupSheets`) with hard-coded function lists that must be updated whenever a new sheet is added | 1 `syncAllHeaders()` that discovers from config (no manual list) |
| Also: 23+ uses of `DriveApp.getFilesByName('JLMops_Data')` (violates `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §5) | 1 use of `SheetAccessor.getDataSpreadsheet()` |
| Misnamed "create" | Correctly named "sync" |

`protectAllSheetHeaders()` + `protectAllSheetHeadersFromUI()` + `createSysProductAuditHeaders()` (separate from the main batch, lines 818+) get the same consolidation treatment as part of the same refactor.

**Risk:** low. The new function does the exact same work; only the entry-point surface changes. Apps Script editor invocations from the user side change from `createWebXltSHeaders()` → `syncHeaders('WebXltS')` — a documented rename, easy to teach.

**Recommendation:** do §7.1 and §7.3 in the same pass — both touch `Setup*.js` files, both require a `clasp push`, neither has runtime risk (the deleted/replaced functions aren't called from runtime code).
