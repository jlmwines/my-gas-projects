**When to Spend More (And When Not To)**

We've all stood in front of a wine shelf wondering: **Does that ₪150
bottle actually taste better than the ₪50 one?** The honest answer might
surprise you.

**What the Research Actually Shows**

Wine expert ratings are far less reliable than you'd think. In a [study
of California State Fair
judges](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2009/02/01/wine-judges-fail-taste-test/),
the same judge tasting the same wine three times---from the same
bottle---gave ratings that varied by ±4 points. A wine scored 91 one
moment might get an 87 or 95 the next.

Only 1 in 10 judges rated consistently. And across competitions? 99% of
wines that won gold at one event received no award at another.

**The Judgment of Paris**

Then there's the famous [1976 blind tasting in
Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)). French
experts---the best in the business---were asked to rate French wines
against California wines they'd never heard of. The California wines
won. Both red and white.

One French judge reportedly tried to get her scorecard back so no one
would see what she'd written.

The point isn't that expensive wines are bad. It's that reputation and
price don't guarantee you'll enjoy what's in the glass.

**What Higher Prices Actually Buy**

When you pay more, you're usually paying for real things:

- **Better Grapes:** Hand-picked fruit from specific vineyard plots,
  harvested at the perfect moment.

- **More Attention:** Lower yields, more sorting, more care at every
  step.

- **Oak Aging:** Quality barrels add vanilla, spice, and structure---but
  good barrels are expensive.

- **Time:** Wines that age longer before release require patience and
  storage.

These investments genuinely affect the wine. A well-made premium bottle
often has more depth, more layers, more to discover. But "more" isn't
always "better for you"---it depends on what you enjoy.

**When to Spend More**

- You want a wine with layers that unfold over the evening
- You're pairing with a rich, special meal
- You want to slow down and pay attention to what's in your glass
- You're celebrating something worth remembering

**When to Spend Less**

- You want something refreshing and easy
- The wine is playing a supporting role to the food or conversation
- You're stocking up for everyday drinking
- You'd rather discover three good bottles than one great one

**Our Promise at Every Price**

Here's what we believe: every bottle we sell should be worth what you
pay for it.

We taste wines at every price point with the same critical eye. A ₪50
bottle has to deliver a ₪50 experience. A ₪150 bottle has to justify
that price in the glass---not just on the label.

When we offer a premium wine, we're not just passing along a winery's
reputation. We've tasted it ourselves, compared it against alternatives,
and decided it's worth your money. Our reputation is on every packing
slip, at every price.

**Where to Find Great Value**

Looking for wines that over-deliver? Our [Value
Bundles](#Xa39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709) are built around
bottles that punch above their weight---wines where you get more than
the price suggests.

For premium bottles we genuinely believe in, look for our curated
selections---wines we'd serve at our own table.

**The ₪50 vs. ₪150 Question**

French experts picked California wines over their own.

So when is it worth spending more? And how do you know you're getting
real value?

  matter. Higher prices often buy better grapes, more attention, quality

  place through tasting, not label.
