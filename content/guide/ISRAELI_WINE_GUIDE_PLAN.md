## Editorial Approach: No Ratings

**We describe, we don't score.**

### Why No Ratings
- JLM curation is the implicit rating - if it's in the catalog, it passed the bar
- Aligns with brand voice ("never says anything negative")
- Opens winery partnership opportunities (no fear of bad scores)
- Anti-snob positioning - ratings feel like wine snobbery
- Focus on discovery and matching, not judgment

### What Replaces Ratings
- Sensory descriptors (intensity, complexity, acidity)
- Pairing guidance
- Occasion matching ("casual Tuesday" vs "special dinner")
- "If you like X, try Y" recommendations
- Winemaker stories and philosophy

### Positioning
We're building a **guide**, not a scorecard. Authority comes from depth and usefulness, not judgment. Different from Rogov - complementary, not replacement.

## Content Architecture

### Hub & Spoke Structure (SEO Strategy)

Each category has one **Overview Post** (the hub/pillar) plus multiple **Individual Posts** (spokes).

| Category | Overview Post (Hub) | Individual Posts (Spokes) |

| History | "The History of Israeli Wine" | 4-6 period posts |
| Uniqueness | "What Makes Israeli Wine Different" | 4-6 topic posts |
| People | "The People Behind Israeli Wine" | 8-12 profile posts |

**SEO Benefits:**
- Overview pages rank for broad terms ("Israeli wine regions")
- Individual posts rank for specific terms ("Golan Heights wine")
- Strong internal linking (overview ↔ individual posts)
- Topic authority signal to search engines
- Featured snippet potential on overview pages
- External sites prefer linking to comprehensive overviews

## Production Approach

### Writing Pipeline

- Queue 2 weeks ahead
- Batch similar posts (all regions, then all grapes)

### Quality Gates
Draft → Edit → Translate → Publish (EN + HE simultaneously)

Overviews update as individual posts publish

---

## Research Needed

- [ ] Map wineries to regions (verify locations)
- [ ] Extract grape varieties from inventory
- [ ] Identify exemplary wines for each category
- [ ] Source historical dates/figures
- [ ] Find comparison data (European regions)
- [ ] Locate/commission maps and visuals
- [ ] Contact regional wine councils/marketing bodies for content input

---

## Additional Features

### Seasonal Calendar
Tie content to Jewish holidays and seasons. Existing holiday wine content can be integrated.
- Pesach / Passover
- Rosh Hashanah
- Shabbat / Friday night
- Summer drinking
- Harvest season (September-October)

Seasonal posts drive recurring annual traffic.

### Product Page Integration
- Product pages link TO relevant guide content (region, grape, winery)
- Guide posts include search tool (already in place)
- Creates content web between shop and guide

### Industry Relationships

**Now (for content):**
- Contact regional wine councils and marketing bodies
- Information gathering, not partnerships

**Later (from position of authority):**
- Guest contributors (winemakers, sommeliers)
- Winery partnerships for annual edition
- Tour operator cross-promotion

Establish authority first, then leverage it.

### Hebrew Market Strategy
Hebrew edition essential for:
- Industry credibility and connections
- Israeli audience authority
- Local media coverage

Not primary revenue source - English market is larger for book sales. Hebrew is strategic, not commercial.

## Open Questions

1. How many winery posts in first release? (Suggest 10-12)
2. Include non-Israeli wines from JLM catalog? (Suggest: mention as comparison only)
3. Depth of European comparison in each post?
4. Photography/visual approach - stock, AI, commissioned?
5. Hebrew translation timing - parallel or after English complete?
