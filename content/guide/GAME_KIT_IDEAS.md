# Wine Play: Game Kit Series

## Concept

Free periodic downloadable game kits with JLM branding. Not dependent on purchasing JLM wines - works with any wine or no wine at all.

**Strategy:**
- Free downloads build email list
- Branded materials = brand exposure at dinner tables
- Regular releases = reason to contact customers
- Generosity builds trust and goodwill
- Some percentage converts to wine purchases naturally

---

## Core Principles

1. **Wine is the occasion, not the lesson** - Most kits should work even if players know nothing about wine
2. **No right answers** - Debate and conversation, not quizzes
3. **Anti-snob test** - Would a friend say this at a dinner party? Does anyone feel dumb?
4. **Branded but not salesy** - JLM logo present, no purchase pressure

## Category 1: Wine as Excuse (People Games)

### "Questions & Corks" - Date Night
- 40 conversation cards in three levels: Light, Deep, Dreams
- Wine is just the reason you're sitting together
- No wine knowledge needed
- "What's a risk you're glad you took?" not "What grape is this?"

### "Remember When" - Anniversary / Reunion
- Memory prompt cards tied to milestones
- "Pour something and tell the story of..."
- First date, first home, best trip, worst decision that turned out fine
- Could include "decade cards" for big anniversaries

### "New Friends" - Dinner Party Icebreaker
- Quick-round cards for when guests don't know each other well
- "Would you rather" style, light debates, harmless confessions
- Host pours, guests talk

### "The Long Table" - Family Gathering
- Cross-generational prompts
- "Ask the oldest person..." / "Ask the youngest..."
- Stories, advice, family lore
- Wine makes the asking easier

---

## Category 2: Guessing Games

### "What's It Worth?" - Price Blind
- Taste blind, guess the price
- Closest guess wins
- Reveals the "value" conversation naturally
- Ties to "price ≠ quality" content

### "High or Low" - Quick Rounds
- Two wines, guess which costs more
- Fast, fun, often surprising
- Great for parties

### "The Lineup" - Group Challenge
- 4-5 wines, rank them by price
- Teams compete
- Usually hilariously wrong

---

## Category 3: Art & Senses

### "Canvas & Cork"
- Cards show abstract art / colors / textures
- "Which image matches this wine?"
- No right answer - debate is the game
- Uses visual framework (watercolor → portrait → vivid canvas)

### "Soundtrack" - Music Matching
- Match wine to music moods/genres
- Playlist cards or Spotify links
- "Is this wine jazz or rock?"
- Unique to JLM's music metaphor

### "The Gallery"
- Each player draws/describes the wine as an image
- Others guess which wine they're describing
- Funny, memorable, shareable photos

---

## Category 4: Food Forward

### "What's for Dinner?" - Reverse Pairing
- Card shows a dish
- Players argue which wine (of those on table) fits best
- Teaches pairing without teaching

### "Menu Builder" - Host Planning Tool
- Not a game, but a tool
- Cards with dish categories + wine pairing hints
- "Planning a dinner? Draw 3 courses, we'll suggest wines"

### "Quick Bites" Cards
- 20 cards with simple appetizer ideas
- Each lists wine styles that work
- Practical, not precious

---

## Category 5: Party Games

### "Two Truths & A Wine"
- Classic game, wine twist
- "Two truths about me, one lie - guess while we drink"

### "Hot Takes"
- Controversial-ish opinion cards
- "Rosé is underrated" - agree or disagree?
- Light debates, no stakes

### "Predictions"
- At start of evening, everyone writes predictions
- "By end of night, [person] will..."
- Read at end, drink to the accurate ones

### "The Sommelier" - Light Roleplay
- One person plays sommelier, others are difficult customers
- "I want something that tastes like Tuesday"
- Silly, no wine knowledge needed

---

## Category 6: Experience Themes

### "First Time For Everything"
- Cards prompt trying something new
- New grape, new region, new food pairing
- "Tonight, everyone tries one thing they've never had"

### "Passport" - World Tour
- Region cards with brief context
- "Tonight we're exploring..."
- Could tie to Israeli guide or import wines

### "Vintage You"
- Find a wine from your birth year (or milestone year)
- Share what was happening in your life that year
- Wine is the memory anchor

---

## Host Tools (Not Games)

### "The Host's Cheat Sheet"
- PDF: "Having 6 people? Here's what to prep"
- Shopping list templates
- "Cheese board that works with everything"
- Simple appetizers that pair broadly
- "Don't stress" reassurance built in

---

## The JLM Framework Games

For those who DO want to learn the vocabulary:

### "The Three Dials"
- Intensity (Volume): Background → Headphones → Concert
- Complexity (Instruments): Solo → Quartet → Orchestra
- Acidity (Brightness): Cello → Balanced → Violin

Players "set the dials" using circles (●●●○○). No right answers - "do you agree?"

### "Harmonize or Contrast"
- Food scenario cards
- Debate which wine style fits
- Teaches pairing system naturally

---
