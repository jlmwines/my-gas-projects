# JLM Wines: Sensory Guide & Metaphor Framework

This document serves as the master guide for explaining wine characteristics to JLM Wines customers. We use a unified **Audio (Music)** and **Visual (Art)** framework to make abstract concepts tangible.

The core philosophy: **The Flavor (Fruit)** is the *Subject* or *Song*. The characteristics below describe *how* that subject is presented.

### 1. INTENSITY (Volume & Saturation)
*The Power / The Force of Impact*

| Level | 🎵 Audio | 🎨 Visual | **🍷 In The Glass** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW (1-2)** | **A Soft Whisper**<br>Low volume and minimal force. A small-scale, intimate performance. | **Pale Tones**<br>Light, faded, and translucent colors. | **Subtle & Gentle**<br>The flavors wash over the palate lightly without demanding attention. |
| **MEDIUM (3)** | **Room-Filling Presence**<br>Moderate volume and steady force. A mid-scale performance that fills the space. | **Bold Colors**<br>Solid, clear, and well-defined colors. | **Present & Defined**<br>The wine asserts itself with a clear, steady weight on the palate. |
| **HIGH (4-5)** | **Thundering Force**<br>Maximum volume and massive power. A large-scale, high-impact performance. | **Saturated Hues**<br>Deep, intense, and high-impact colors. | **Concentrated & Powerful**<br>A high-impact wall of flavor that coats the mouth and persists. |

### 2. COMPLEXITY (Instrumentation & Detail)
*The Variety / The Number of Elements*
*(The same composition, played with more or fewer instruments)*

| Level | 🎵 Audio | 🎨 Visual | **🍷 In The Glass** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW (1-2)** | **Solo or Duet**<br>One or two instruments playing the melody. Simple and direct. | **Simple Sketch**<br>A clean drawing using one or two primary lines. | **Focused & Direct**<br>One or two dominant flavors (such as pure fruit or mineral) without other distractions. |
| **MEDIUM (3)** | **Small Ensemble**<br>A trio of instruments playing the melody with added harmonies. | **Shaded Painting**<br>A composition with three distinct levels of depth or detail. | **Nuanced**<br>A trio of distinct layers where the main flavor is supported by secondary notes of spice or earth. |
| **HIGH (4-5)** | **Full Orchestra**<br>A full ensemble of instruments weaving the melody into a complex wall of sound. | **Intricate Mosaic**<br>An ensemble of elements forming a vast, detailed scene. | **Multidimensional**<br>An ensemble of flavors that unfold and evolve from the first sip to the finish. |

### 3. ACIDITY (The Frequency Mix & Lighting)
*The Definition / The Energy*
*(The same performance, but with different instruments emphasized)*

| Level | 🎵 Audio | 🎨 Visual | **🍷 In The Glass** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW (1-2)** | **The Bass Mix**<br>Emphasis on deep drums and rumbly bass. Warm, rounded, and smooth. | **Soft Focus / Golden Hour**<br>Warm glows and soft edges. | **Smooth & Round**<br>A soft mouthfeel that glides across the tongue without any sharp edges or "bite." |
| **MEDIUM (3)** | **The Balanced Mix**<br>Natural clarity across all frequencies. | **Natural Daylight**<br>Clear visibility where colors look true and crisp. | **Fresh & Lifted**<br>A clean and bright energy that leaves the palate feeling refreshed. |
| **HIGH (4-5)** | **The Sparkle Mix**<br>Emphasis on sharp high-hats, cymbals, and glittering triangles. Bright, fresh, and full of sparkle. | **High Contrast / Noon Sun**<br>Sharp shadows and sparkling, bright highlights. | **Electric & Zesty**<br>An immediate mouth-watering sensation that adds brilliant definition and "zing." |

### 4. VISUALIZING THE CONCEPTS (Video & Media)

For video content (Instagram/TikTok), use a **Split-Screen Progression**:

*   **Left Screen (Audio):** An audio mixer/EQ graphic sliding from Low to High.
*   **Right Screen (Visual):** An image transforming from Sketch $\to$ Painting $\to$ Mosaic, or Pastel $\to$ Vivid.
*   **Center:** The wine pour, visually matching the intensity (e.g., a light pour vs. a heavy, rich glug).
