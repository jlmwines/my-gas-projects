**A Year in Wine: From Vine to Glass**

Wine starts in the dirt and ends in your glass. Between those two points
is a year of work---pruning, watching, waiting, picking, crushing,
racking, blending, and more waiting. This is what that year looks like
from our vineyard southeast of Nokdim in the Judean hills.

The vineyard has an older section of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, and
newer plantings of Syrah, Petit Verdot, Grenache, Colombard, Assyrtiko,
and Chenin Blanc. The cellar work follows the rhythm of what the vines
give us.

## December

**In the vineyard:** The vines are dormant now, bare branches against
the Judean sky. This is the quiet season---the land resting after
harvest. We walk the rows checking for damage, planning next year's
work. The older Malbec and Cabernet blocks show their age in thick,
gnarled trunks. The younger plantings are still finding their feet.

**In the cellar:** The whites from this year's harvest---Colombard,
Assyrtiko, Chenin Blanc---are settling in tank. Cold and clear, waiting
to be tasted and blended. The reds are in barrel, just beginning their
long rest. Early tastings are promising but patience is everything now.

---

## November

**In the vineyard:** Post-harvest cleanup. We're clearing debris,
checking irrigation lines, spreading compost where the soil needs help.
The Judean hills get their first real rains, and the vines drink deeply
before going dormant. Next year's growth starts underground, invisible.

**In the cellar:** Primary fermentation is complete. The young wines are
off their skins and settling. Whites go to tank for cold stabilization.
Reds go to barrel---oak or steel depending on the style we're chasing.
The cellar smells like wine now, not fruit.

---

## October

**In the vineyard:** The main event. Red harvest. The Grenache comes
first---it ripens early and needs to come in before the sugars get too
high. Then Syrah, rich and dark. Finally the Bordeaux varieties:
Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot. These hang longest, building
structure and depth. We pick by taste, not calendar. When the seeds are
brown and the stems are woody, it's time.

**In the cellar:** Controlled chaos. Grapes arrive, get sorted, crushed,
and start fermenting within hours. The cellar is warm with fermentation,
the air thick with CO2. We punch down the cap twice daily, taste
constantly, watch temperatures. Sleep is optional.

---

## September

**In the vineyard:** White harvest. The Assyrtiko comes first---it holds
its acidity beautifully even in our heat. Then Colombard and Chenin
Blanc. These need to come in cool, so we pick at dawn when the grapes
are still cold from the night. By mid-month, we're watching the reds
closely, testing sugars, waiting.

**In the cellar:** Pressing the whites. Gentle, slow, cold. The juice
goes straight to tank to settle overnight, then racked off the heavy
lees. Temperature control is everything---we want the fruit flavors
intact, not cooked.

---

## August

**In the vineyard:** Veraison in the reds. The green grapes soften and
change color---Cabernet goes purple-black, Grenache turns almost
translucent pink before deepening. This is when we start thinning:
dropping clusters so the vine can focus its energy on fewer, better
grapes. The whites are nearly ready; we're tasting every few days.

**In the cellar:** Last year's reds are still aging quietly. We rack
them off the sediment, taste for development, top up the barrels. Oxygen
is the enemy and the friend---a little through the oak staves is good,
too much in the headspace is disaster.

---

## July

**In the vineyard:** The whites are going through veraison now.
Assyrtiko's berries soften and turn golden. We're managing canopy
heavily---pulling leaves to expose fruit to morning sun while keeping
shade for the brutal afternoon. The Judean summer is unforgiving; the
vines are tough but they need help.

**In the cellar:** Planning harvest logistics. Checking tanks, testing
pumps, ordering supplies. The calm before the storm. We're also making
final blending decisions on last year's wines---what works together,
what stands alone, what needs more time.

---

## June

**In the vineyard:** Fruit set. The flowers have become tiny green
grapes, BB-sized and hard. Now we can estimate the crop size. Too much?
We'll thin later. Too little? Nothing to do but accept what the vines
decided. We're still managing shoots, tucking them into the trellis,
keeping the canopy open for airflow.

**In the cellar:** Quiet work. Topping barrels, tasting, taking notes.
The wines are developing their own personalities now. Some are forward
and generous; others are closed and brooding. Both can be great.

---

## May

**In the vineyard:** Flowering. The vines are covered in tiny blooms,
unremarkable to look at but everything depends on them. We need calm,
warm days---wind and rain during flowering means poor fruit set. The
vineyard smells faintly sweet. We hold our breath and wait.

**In the cellar:** Racking the reds. We move them off the sediment that
has settled over winter, giving them fresh oak or steel to rest in.
This is also when we taste with fresh perspective---months have passed
since harvest, and the wines are showing their true character.

---

## April

**In the vineyard:** Explosive growth. Shoots are lengthening daily,
leaves unfurling. We're doing first-pass canopy management: removing
extra shoots, positioning what's left. The vines want to grow wildly;
our job is to channel that energy toward quality fruit, not excessive
foliage.

**In the cellar:** Spring cleaning. We're washing barrels, checking
seals, preparing for the long aging months ahead. Some whites are
nearing bottling; we're doing final tastings, making last adjustments.

---

## March

**In the vineyard:** Budbreak. After months of dormancy, tiny green
shoots emerge from the buds. This is the anxious season---a late frost
could kill the new growth. We watch the weather obsessively. The newer
plantings break first; the old Malbec takes its time, as old vines do.

**In the cellar:** Last year's wines are mid-aging. We taste regularly,
tracking development. Some wines are on schedule; others surprise us.
The Assyrtiko is already bright and lively. The Cabernet is still
tight, hiding its cards.

---

## February

**In the vineyard:** Final pruning. We're shaping the vines for the
coming year, deciding how many buds to leave. More buds means more
fruit but diluted quality. Fewer buds means concentrated grapes but
lower yield. Every cut is a choice. The older blocks get severe pruning;
we want intensity, not quantity.

**In the cellar:** Malolactic fermentation is finishing in the reds.
This secondary fermentation softens the wines, converting sharp malic
acid to gentler lactic. We taste to track progress. Some wines we let go
fully through; others we stop early to preserve freshness.

---

## January

**In the vineyard:** Deep winter. The vines are fully dormant,
leafless, still. This is when we begin pruning---the most important
work of the vineyard year. Last year's growth is cut back to a few
carefully chosen buds. It looks brutal but the vine needs it. We start
with the older Malbec and Cabernet, working methodically through the rows.

**In the cellar:** The new wines are settling after the chaos of
harvest. Whites are resting cold; reds are beginning their barrel
aging. The cellar is quiet and cold. We taste, take notes, and wait.
Most of winemaking is waiting.
