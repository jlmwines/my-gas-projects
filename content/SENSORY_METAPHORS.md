# JLM Wines: The Sensory Metaphor Framework

This document serves as the single source of truth for the JLM Wines brand voice and educational metaphors. We explain wine characteristics through the dual lenses of **Audio (Sound)** and **Visual (Art)**, using a consistent **Low-Medium-High** 3-level scale.

---

## Core Philosophy
We treat the **Flavor** (the grape/fruit) as the **Subject** of the piece. The characteristics below describe *how* that subject is presented to the customer.

---

## 1. INTENSITY (The "Volume" / The "Saturation")
*Definition: The force and concentration of the delivery. How "loud" or "vivid" is the wine?*

| Level | Audio (The Ear) | Visual (The Eye) | Wine Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW** (1-2) | **The Acoustic Solo**<br>A gentle, unplugged performance. Soft and intimate. | **The Watercolor**<br>Translucent pastel washes. Light and delicate touches. | Light-bodied, effortless to drink, doesn't tire the palate. |
| **MEDIUM** (3) | **The Studio Mix**<br>A clear, balanced recording. Present and defined. | **The Portrait**<br>A standard oil painting. Defined colors and clear weight. | The "All-Rounder." Noticeable presence but remains approachable. |
| **HIGH** (4-5) | **The Stadium Anthem**<br>A powerful, booming performance that fills the room. | **The Vivid Canvas**<br>Thick oil impasto with intense saturation and bold impact. | Full-bodied and powerful. It "coats" the mouth with grip and force. |

---

## 2. COMPLEXITY (The "Instrumentation" / The "Detail")
*Definition: The number of layers and elements in the glass. How much is happening at once?*

| Level | Audio (The Ear) | Visual (The Eye) | Wine Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW** (1-2) | **The Solo**<br>A single instrument playing the melody clearly. | **The Sketch**<br>A clean, minimalist pencil drawing. Pure and direct. | One clear flavor (e.g., just fresh fruit). Easy to enjoy without overthinking. |
| **MEDIUM** (3) | **The Quartet**<br>A small band. You hear the melody plus a rhythm section. | **The Painting**<br>A detailed scene with a clear subject and a background. | Fruit-forward, but with secondary notes like flowers or light spice. |
| **HIGH** (4-5) | **The Orchestra**<br>A full symphony with dozens of instruments in harmony. | **The High-Res Mosaic**<br>Thousands of tiny tiles or pixels creating infinite detail. | An evolving journey. Layers of fruit, earth, spice, wood, and herbs. |

## 3. ACIDITY (The "Treble" / The "Lighting")
*Definition: The definition, brightness, and "cut" of the wine. How sharp are the highlights?*

| Level | Audio (The Ear) | Visual (The Eye) | Wine Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LOW** (1-2) | **The Bass**<br>Warm, rumbly, and deep. Low on the treble. | **The Soft Focus**<br>"Golden Hour" light. Warm glows and soft edges. | Smooth, round, and creamy. No sharp edges. |
| **MEDIUM** (3) | **The Balanced EQ**<br>Perfectly balanced highs and lows. Clear and natural. | **Natural Light**<br>Clear daylight where colors look true and crisp. | Fresh and refreshing, but not tart. Balanced energy. |
| **HIGH** (4-5) | **The Treble**<br>Sharp high-hats and cymbals. Crisp and cutting. | **High Contrast**<br>Bright noon sun. Sharp shadows and sparkling highlights. | Zesty, mouth-watering, and electric ("The Zing"). |

## 4. PAIRING (Harmony vs. Contrast)

*   **Harmony (Matching the Vibe):** Pairing high-intensity wine with rich food is like matching a loud rock anthem to a high-energy party. The "Volume" of both matches.
*   **Contrast (Balancing the Spectrum):** Using high-acidity wine to cut through fatty food is like a sharp cymbal crash cutting through a deep bass line. It provides clarity and prevents the dish from feeling "muffled."
