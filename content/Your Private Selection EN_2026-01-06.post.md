## TITLE
Our selection for you: How We Choose What You See

## EXCERPT
Every wine on the site earned its place through tasting - not reputation, not price, not a flashy label. Here's how we find the bottles that become part of your collection.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why We Taste Every Vintage</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wine is an agricultural product, shaped by rain, sun and timing. The same label you loved last year might and should taste a bit different this year—maybe richer, maybe lighter, maybe even better than before. A wine that impressed us two years ago might surprise us again, or it might need some time to be ready.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is part of what makes wine fascinating. But it also means someone needs to stay current, tasting each new vintage as it arrives rather than relying on old impressions. When a specific vintage is singing, it finds its way into your collection. When it's not quite there, there's usually an alternative from a different source.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What We're Looking For</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When samples arrive at the warehouse office, every bottle gets evaluated fresh. Here's how we think about it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>The Situation</th><th>What Happens</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A vintage is particularly good</td><td>It finds its way into your collection—these are the wines worth enjoying</td></tr><tr><td>A vintage needs more time</td><td>We wait. Better to skip a year than offer something that isn't ready</td></tr><tr><td>A lesser-known winery has something interesting</td><td>If it excites us, it earns a place alongside the favorites</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selection you see isn't static. It evolves with each vintage, each discovery, each new find that catches our attention.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Search for Something Interesting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We love the classics — the reliable bottles that deliver year after year. But we also believe some of the best discoveries come from places you might not expect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe it's an emerging winery that's doing something genuinely exciting. Maybe it's an unusual grape variety that turns out to be exactly what you didn't know you were looking for. Maybe it's an ancient winemaking tradition brought back to life with modern care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the wines that add depth to your options and a sense of discovery to your table. When a lesser-known bottle has something interesting to offer, it earns its place right alongside the established names.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Tasting Session</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When samples arrive, the tasting happens in the warehouse office. Morning tastings work best when the palate is freshest and before the day's distractions begin. It's a quiet, focused time: methodical evaluation, careful notes, honest comparisons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More of a workshop than a gala. Some bottles impress immediately. Others reveal their character slowly. The goal is always the same: to find wines that will genuinely enhance your experience — bottles you'll be glad to see at your door.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Value Question</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond the taste, a wine has to make sense for your table. A beautiful bottle should have a price that matches the experience it provides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some wines are lovely but prices have drifted beyond what we feel the experience justifies — we appreciate them, but they don't make the cut. Others offer remarkable quality at a price that feels almost unfair. These special finds let you explore new regions and varieties with confidence, knowing the value is real.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal isn't to find the lowest-priced wines or the most prestigious ones. It's to find wines where what's in the glass truly justifies what you pay, and sometimes, delightfully exceeds it.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selection you see has already been carefully considered. Every wine earned its place. Whether you're reaching for a familiar favorite or trying something new, you're choosing from bottles we believe in.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's the work we do in the warehouse office, so you can simply enjoy what arrives. Your collection, curated before you even browse.</p>
