You Already Know What Good Wine Is

## EXCERPT
Does a higher price mean a better bottle? Not necessarily. We believe the real test of a 'good' wine is much simpler: if you want a second sip, it's a winner. From understanding the 'volume' of a red to the 'refreshment' of a white, here is our simple guide to finding your next favorite bottle without the jargon.

<p>Have you ever had a wine that you really enjoyed, but don't know to describe why you enjoyed it?  The world of wine is vast, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the thousands of choices available. But one question often arises: <em>What makes a wine "good"?</em> At JLM Wines, we subscribe to a rule famously set by a Manhattan restaurateur: <strong>If after the first sip, you want another sip, it's a good wine.</strong> Since taste is personal, the "best" wine isn't the most expensive one—it's the one that matches your mood and your palate. To help you find your next favorite bottle, we look at three simple concepts that help you understand how a wine feels in your mouth.</p>

<p>When you are trying to decide why you liked a certain bottle (or why you didn't), think about these three characteristics:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Intensity (The Volume):</strong> Some wines are quiet and delicate, while others are loud and bold. Think of this as the "weight" of the wine. Does it fill your mouth with deep, dark fruit flavors, or does it feel light and effortless?</li><li><strong>Complexity (The Story):</strong> A simple wine tastes like one thing (usually fruit) from start to finish. A complex wine tells a longer story—you might taste fruit at first, followed by a hint of earthiness, spice, or even a woody note on the finish.</li><li><strong>Acidity (The Refreshment):</strong> Mostly felt in whites and rosés, this is that mouth-watering, "crisp" feeling. It's what makes a wine feel bright and refreshing rather than flat or heavy.</li></ul>

<h3>Three Things That Change the Experience</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you know if you prefer a "loud" wine or a "crisp" one, consider these factors:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Context Matters:</strong> A bold, intense red that might be absolutely perfect when paired with a rich, savory dinner may feel heavy on a hot afternoon. The right setting can make a good wine feel great.</li><li><strong>The Mystery of the Vintage:</strong> Because wine comes from nature, it changes every year. A favorite wine might be bright and acidic one year, and more mellow the next, depending on the weather throughout the summer. This variation is part of the fun—every bottle is a snapshot of a specific moment in time.</li><li><strong>Trust Your Source:</strong> You shouldn't have to be an expert to get a great bottle. Having a vendor who vets every vintage ensures that the "hard work" is already done.</li></ol>
