We taste all of our wines to ensure quality
Once you find the qualities you enjoy then you may want a deeper experience if it enhances the qualities you enjoy
Better quality starts in the vineyard with grapes being grown and nurtured specifically for the style of wine they’ll present later, more rigorous grape sorting and very specific harvest timing.
It continues in the winery with highly specialized machinery to gently process the grapes at every stage, specific fermentation temperatures and a sensitive approach to each batch of wine. The choice of barrels, bottles and even closures.
The results of this give us wines with distinct qualities.

When do we need it?
If I need to know the time, most watches will do the job. Be it a cheap watch or a rolex, I’ll enjoy them equally. If i take joy in the artistry and absolute precision then I will be more likely to spend and buy an expensive watch which will bring me that joy.
If i like singing along to songs I enjoy, i likely don’t need a high quality set of speakers. But If i’m a huge fan of a specific genre, I may want to spend a lot of money to see my favorite artists play live.
Each vintage of each wine is a unique expression. If that’s something that excites you - then it’s worth spending more on.


When to not spend more money?
When other people or wine critics tell you its a great wine but don’t know what you enjoy
