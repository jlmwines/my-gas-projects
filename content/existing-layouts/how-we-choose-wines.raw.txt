<p>We, at JLM Wines, are constantly on a thrilling, yet daunting, adventure: selecting the best wines to offer you. It's a journey that starts with a simple question: What are the most exciting, delicious, and value-driven wines available right now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answers are not so easily found. We begin by casting a wide net, trying to get as many wines from as many sources as possible. The world of wine is dynamic, and wines can change dramatically from year to year. This means we need to taste new wines, and every new vintage of returning wines to ensure we're offering the best possible selection. The result is a lot of wines that need tasting.</p>

<p>Our wine tastings are not the glamorous events you may imagine. We gather in our office/warehouse around 10 AM and continue sampling the endless wave of wines. Every wine has notes written and what we think it is worth to the consumer. We look for wines of every type, well known classics or emerging wineries, lesser-known grape varieties, interesting examples of winemaking technique, and other noteworthy wine characteristics.</p>

<p>Many wines are opened. Small amounts are poured and tasted, but not swallowed (well, almost never). We discover some very pleasing wines, and make note of them. Sadly, the remaining wine can’t really be kept and used. We may pour out more wine each month than the average customer buys in a year, but we can offer customers the best.</p>

<p>Finally, every wine chosen must pass the price test. A great wine still needs to have a price that is in line with the experience. Some wines that we otherwise love are skipped because the price seems high. Others deliver more than the price might lead you to expect. We keep a list of these "Special Value" wines, so you can enjoy quality wine at great prices, and to explore new wines at low cost.</p>
