<p>The world of wine is a vast and wondrous place, filled with countless varieties, flavors, and experiences. But one question often arises: what makes a wine "good"? Beyond that: what makes a wine good for me?</p>

<p>The truth is, there's no single answer. What one person considers a "good" wine, another might find bland or overpowering<strong>.</strong> We subscribe to the rule set by a Manhattan restauranteur: If after the first sip, you want another sip, it's a good wine. It's that simple.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sheer variety of wine types and the enormous range of wine experiences make it impossible to define what is a "good" wine for everyone. The best approach is to make that distinction for yourself.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here are some things to consider:</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Know your preferences:</strong> Start by understanding what you enjoy. Do you prefer dry red wines with intense fruit and complex tannins, or light and refreshing whites<strong> </strong>with crisp acidity? Knowing and understanding your basic preferences will help you navigate the vast world of wine. If you enjoy more than one type of wine (we hope for you that this is your case), you may find yourself wanting one type at a certain time and another wine for a different occasion.<strong> </strong>This leads us to the next point:</li>

<li><strong>Context matters: </strong>The occasion and setting can influence your perception of a wine. A robust red might be perfect for a hearty meal, while a delicate white might be more appropriate for a light lunch.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Vintage matters:</strong> Even a favorite wine can change dramatically from year to year, due to variations in weather and other factors. That's why the vintage is mentioned for most wines and is an important factor to consider. The most beautiful and frustrating thing about a wine you enjoy, is that it will never be exactly replicated.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Trust your source:</strong> Having a reliable vendor who cares about giving you the best wine experience that suits your tastes and preferences is indispensable. Having someone who concentrates on the things you care about in wine and offers you wines that continue and enhance your wine journey is key.</li>
