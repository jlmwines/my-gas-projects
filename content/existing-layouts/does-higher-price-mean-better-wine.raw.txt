<p>We all love a good glass of wine, but the question of price vs. quality can be a real head-scratcher. Does that ₪80 bottle really taste twice as good as the ₪40 bottle? The answer, as with most things in life, is a bit more nuanced than a simple yes or no.</p>

<p><strong>Vineyard Management</strong>: Wineries that invest in meticulous vineyard management, like sustainable farming practices and hand-pruning, produce grapes that lead to wines with greater complexity and depth of flavor. These practices are often reflected in a higher price.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting</strong>: Hand-harvesting, where grapes are carefully selected and picked by hand, ensures only the best fruit makes it into the bottle. This labor-intensive process contributes to the final cost.</p>

<p><strong>Winemaking Techniques</strong>: At every stage, from fermentation tanks to the oak barrel used for aging and even the bottling. The choices made during winemaking directly impact the wine's character and complexity. These techniques often involve additional costs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Barrel Aging</strong>: Aging wines in oak barrels adds complexity, depth, and structure. The type of oak, the length of aging, and the barrel's toasting level all influence the final price.</p>

<p>But, here's the catch: Matching a wine to someone’s preferences will always lead to a better result. There's a growing movement questioning the validity of traditional wine evaluations and competitions. They often are a mark of different qualities in a wine, but that doesn’t indicate that you will enjoy this wine.</p>

<p>In order to bring wines whose price-quality ratio is aligned, we continually taste as many wines in the Israeli marketplace as possible. <em>While selecting those with the best quality, examples of interesting winemaking techniques, lesser-known grape varieties, and emerging wineries - we check one more thing: <strong>the price</strong>.</em> Whether it is an inexpensive everyday bottle or a flagship wine from any of the wineries, we only include wines whose experience is as good, or better, than the price implies.</p>
