<p>Many people feel they need a degree in culinary arts to pair wine with food. It really should be as simple as choosing a side dish.  One rule matters most - if you enjoy or are in the mood for a very specific type of wine - that is the wine that will best accompany your meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forget the technical rules. Here are two simple ways to think about your glass and your plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Secret 1: Choose Your Pairing Style</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of memorizing flavor profiles, just ask yourself how you want the tastes to interact:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Harmonizing:</strong> The wine and food share the same energy. A crisp, bright white with grilled fish—both are light and refreshing. They complement each other naturally, each reinforcing the other.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Contrasting:</strong> The wine does what the food cannot. A bold red with a rich, fatty steak—the wine's presence cuts through the richness, refreshing your palate between bites. Both the food and wine are enhanced by the other.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A white wine glass beside a plate of grilled fish with lemon, both glowing in soft golden light. Loose brushstrokes, warm palette of golds and soft greens. Simple composition, shallow depth. 600x400px.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Secret 2: Know Your Food Type</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost every dish fits into one of four groups. Once you know which one you're serving, the wine choice becomes clear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mild</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lightly flavored foods like soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, or pasta in a light sauce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A fresh white wine with crisp acidity and delicate fruit flavors. The wine harmonizes with the gentle flavors without overwhelming them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A delicate white wine glass beside soft brie cheese and a few crackers on a light surface. Very soft and pale — cream, ivory, light gold tones. Gentle, airy brushstrokes. Quiet and elegant. 600x400px.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rich</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heavier flavors like salmon, red meats, fattier foods, hard cheeses, or anything with butter and cream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A medium-intensity red with rich fruit and a bright vibrant personality. Additionally, a white with higher acidity to cut through the richness—the brightness acts like a palate cleanser between bites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A red wine glass beside a wooden board with hard cheese and salmon, warm amber lighting. Rich golds and warm browns, thick impasto texture. Generous and abundant feeling. 600x400px.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Intense</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dishes with big personalities—spicy curries, heavy seasonings, bold garlic, or strong flavors that announce themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A complex red with bold fruit can stand up to the intensity. But here's the important exception: for spicy heat, choose <strong>lower acidity</strong>. High-acid wines amplify the burn, while a softer, warmer-toned wine provides a cooling counterpoint. For a white option - rich and opulent whites will accompany this nicely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A bold red wine glass beside a bowl of dark spicy curry or chili, deep dramatic colors. Deep reds, dark oranges, burgundy tones. Bold brushstrokes, high contrast. Energetic. 600x400px.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sweet</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Desserts, pastries, or savory dishes with sweet glazes, sauces, or fruit components.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A wine with some fruity sweetness of its own, or a lower intensity dry wine. The sweetness harmonizes rather than clashes - intense dry wines may taste bitter against sweet food.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A rosé or light red wine glass beside a slice of fruit tart or pastry, soft pink and golden tones. Delicate and pretty, warm pastels. Light brushstrokes, inviting. 600x400px.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using the Scales</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each wine on our site shows simple 1-5 scales. Here's how to use them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For Red Wines (Intensity &amp; Complexity)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rich foods</strong> love higher <strong>Intensity</strong>—a bold dish needs a wine that won't fade into the background.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Intense dishes</strong> pair well with higher <strong>Complexity</strong>—more layers in the wine means more flavors to engage with the dish's boldness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For White &amp; Rosé Wines (Complexity &amp; Acidity)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rich or creamy dishes</strong> pair with higher <strong>Acidity</strong>—brightness cuts through fat and keeps the meal feeling fresh.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Spicy foods</strong> need <strong>lower Acidity</strong>—high-acid wines amplify heat, while softer wines provide relief.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"background":"#fff3cd"},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"12px","bottom":"12px","left":"16px","right":"16px"}}}} -->
<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fff3cd;padding:12px 16px">Oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes, warm natural lighting, no text or words. A simple still life of two wine glasses side by side, one red and one white, with five small painted dots between them suggesting a 1-5 scale. Balanced warm tones. Clean and instructional but still painterly. 600x400px.</p>
