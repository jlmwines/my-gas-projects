<p>Many people feel they need a degree in culinary arts to pair wine with food. It should be as simple as choosing a side dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forget the technical rules. Here are two simple ways to think about your glass and your plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Secret 1: Choose Your Pairing Style</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of memorizing flavor profiles, just ask yourself how you want the tastes to interact:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Harmonizing:</strong> The wine and food share the same energy. A crisp, bright white with grilled fish—both are light and refreshing. They complement each other naturally, each reinforcing the other.</li><li><strong>Contrasting:</strong> The wine does what the food cannot. A bold red with a rich, fatty steak—the wine's presence cuts through the richness, refreshing your palate between bites. Both the food and wine are enhanced by the other.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Secret 2: Know Your Food Type</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost every dish fits into one of four groups. Once you know which one you're serving, the wine choice becomes clear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Mild</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Light foods like soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, or pasta in a light sauce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A fresh white wine with crisp acidity and delicate fruit flavors. The wine harmonizes with the gentle flavors without overwhelming them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Rich</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heavier flavors like salmon, red meats, fattier foods, hard cheeses, or anything with butter and cream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A medium-intensity red with rich fruit and smooth texture. Or a white with higher acidity to cut through the richness—the brightness acts like a palate cleanser between bites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Intense</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dishes with big personalities—spicy curries, heavy seasonings, bold garlic, or strong flavors that announce themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A complex red with bold fruit can stand up to the intensity. But here's the important exception: for spicy heat, choose <strong>lower acidity</strong>. High-acid wines amplify the burn, while a softer, warmer-toned wine provides a cooling counterpoint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Sweet</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Desserts, pastries, or savory dishes with sweet glazes, sauces, or fruit components.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What works:</em> A wine with some fruity sweetness of its own. The sweetness harmonizes rather than clashes—dry wines can taste bitter against sweet food.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Using the Scales</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each wine on our site shows simple 1-5 scales. Here's how to use them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>For Red Wines (Intensity &amp; Complexity)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Rich foods</strong> love higher <strong>Intensity</strong>—a bold dish needs a wine that won't fade into the background.</li><li><strong>Intense dishes</strong> pair well with higher <strong>Complexity</strong>—more layers in the wine means more flavors to engage with the dish's boldness.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>For White &amp; Rosé Wines (Complexity &amp; Acidity)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Rich or creamy dishes</strong> pair with higher <strong>Acidity</strong>—brightness cuts through fat and keeps the meal feeling fresh.</li><li><strong>Spicy foods</strong> need <strong>lower Acidity</strong>—high-acid wines amplify heat, while softer wines provide relief.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2>Where to Find Pairing Help</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't have to memorize any of this. Both product pages and your packing slip show pairing suggestions—Harmonize or Contrast, and which food types work best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Golden Rule</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are just suggestions. If you love a bold red with your salad, then it's a good pairing. The system is here to help you move from "I'm not sure" to "I'll try that" with confidence.</p>
