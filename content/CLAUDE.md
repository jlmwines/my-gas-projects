# JLM Wines Content Guidelines

Read `business/CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` for full context. This is the quick reference.

---

## The Voice

**Friendly. Personal. Never talks down.**

Write like a trusted friend who happens to know wine—not a sommelier, not a salesperson, not a teacher giving a lecture.

## The Customer

People who drink wine. Not "wine lovers" or hobbyists.

They want:
- Convenience (it shows up, it's good)
- Consistency (no disappointments)
- Zero pretension (don't make me feel dumb)

They do NOT want to learn wine vocabulary.

## The Owner's Tone

- Exceedingly polite—never says anything negative about a brand, winery, wine, or grape
- Earnest and upbeat
- Service-dedicated
- Plain-spoken, no jargon

## Brand Position

**We do the work so you don't have to.**

- Anti-snob: wine without pretension
- Curators: we taste everything, reject what doesn't meet the bar
- Opposite of big retailers pushing whatever wineries need to dump
- But we show this through what we DO, never by criticizing others

## Sensory Framework

We use three visual/audio metaphors to describe wine characteristics:

All three use the same song as metaphor:
- **Intensity** = Volume (background music → listening at home → concert venue)
- **Complexity** = Instruments (solo → ensemble → orchestra)
- **Acidity** = Tone (warm cello/bass → balanced → bright violin/flute)

Visual alternatives available for each (thumbnail→fullscreen, sketch→mosaic, soft→bright photo).

**This is an internal tool for consistency—not something customers need to learn.**

Use metaphors to clarify, not to dominate. Customers should never feel they need to "learn" our system.

## Content Purpose

**Build trust, not educate.**

Every piece answers: "Why should I trust you to pick my wine?"

## Quick Checks

Before publishing any content, verify:

- [ ] Would a friend talk this way? (not a professor, not a salesperson)
- [ ] Is it free of wine jargon?
- [ ] Does it respect the reader's time?
- [ ] Is the tone warm and helpful, never condescending?
- [ ] Does it avoid negativity about any wine, brand, or competitor?
