<p>Have you ever noticed that some wines showcase one or two flavors while others seem to unfold into something new with every sip? <strong>Complexity</strong> describes how many different flavors are dancing on your tastebuds at once.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Lower Complexity:</strong> These wines have one clear flavor which is often fresh fruit like blueberries or crisp green apples. They're refreshing, easy-drinking, and perfect when you want something nice without overthinking it. The flavor is direct and honest.</li><li><strong>Medium Complexity:</strong> These wines offer more variety. You'll taste the main fruit, but you'll also notice something secondary, anything from a floral note, a hint of spice or a touch of earthiness. There's more to discover in every sip, but it's still easy to decipher.</li><li><strong>Higher Complexity:</strong> This is a multi-layered experience. You might start with deep fruit which can evolve in itself, but also find additional notes, hints of oak, toasted nuts, vanilla, herbs, or earthy undertones. The sensations shift from the moment the wine hits your tongue to the moment you swallow. Every sip reveals something new.</li></ul>

<h3>Finding Your Level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Complexity isn't about quality, it's about the experience you're in the mood for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple wine is great for a casual afternoon, a weeknight dinner, or when you just want something refreshing without analysis. A highly complex wine is for those times you want to slow down and notice how the flavors unfold and interact—maybe with a special meal or when the wine itself is the focus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither is "better." It's about matching the experience to your moment.</p>

<h3>A Way to Picture It</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of it like music—same song, same volume, but change who's playing:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>A solo or duet</strong> — One or two instruments. The melody is clear, direct, easy to follow. Nothing competes for your attention.</li><li><strong>A small ensemble</strong> — A few more instruments join. You still hear the main melody, but now there's harmony, maybe a counterpoint. More to notice if you listen.</li><li><strong>A full orchestra</strong> — Layers of sound. Strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion. The melody is still there, but it's woven into something richer. Every time you listen, you might notice something new. You can enjoy while focusing on the bigger picture or focus on how specific elements play their part.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wine complexity works the same way. It's not about intensity or brightness—it's about how many flavors are playing at once.</p>

<h3>The Complexity Scale</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each wine shows a <strong>Complexity rating from 1 to 5</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Levels 1 &amp; 2:</strong> One clear flavor, clean and direct.</li><li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Main flavor plus harmonies to discover.</li><li><strong>Levels 4 &amp; 5:</strong> Layers that unfold and evolve.</li></ul>
