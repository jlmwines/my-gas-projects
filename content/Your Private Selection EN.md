**Your Private Selection: How We Choose What You See**

Every wine on the site was tasted before it got there. Not every
bottle - but every vintage, every new arrival, every returning favorite.
Wine is wonderfully unpredictable, and our job is to navigate that
variability so you don't have to.

**Why We Taste Every Vintage**

Wine is an agricultural product, shaped by sun and rain and timing. The
same label you loved last year might taste a bit different this
year---maybe richer, maybe lighter, maybe even better than before. A
wine that impressed us two years ago might surprise us again, or it
might need another season to find its footing.

This is part of what makes wine fascinating. But it also means someone
needs to stay current, tasting each new vintage as it arrives rather
than relying on old impressions. When a vintage is singing, it finds its
way into your collection. When it's not quite there, we wait for a
better year.

**What We're Looking For**

When samples arrive at the warehouse office, every bottle gets evaluated
fresh. Here's how we think about it:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Situation                        What Happens
  ------------------------------------ ----------------------------------
  A vintage is particularly good       It finds its way into your
                                       collection---these are the years
                                       worth enjoying

  A vintage needs more time            We wait. Better to skip a year
                                       than offer something that isn't
                                       ready

  A lesser-known winery has something  If it excites us, it earns a place
  interesting                          alongside the favorites
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The selection you see isn't static. It evolves with each vintage, each
discovery, each new find that catches our attention.

**The Search for Something Interesting**

We love the classics - the reliable bottles that deliver year after
year. But we also believe some of the best discoveries come from places
you might not expect.

Maybe it's an emerging winery that's doing something genuinely exciting.
Maybe it's an unusual grape variety that turns out to be exactly what
you didn't know you were looking for. Maybe it's an ancient winemaking
tradition brought back to life with modern care.

These are the wines that add depth to your options and a sense of
discovery to your table. When a lesser-known bottle has something
interesting to offer, it earns its place right alongside the established
names.

**The Tasting Session**

When samples arrive, the tasting happens in the warehouse office. Late
morning works best. The palate is freshest then, before the day's
distractions begin. It's a quiet, focused time: methodical evaluation,
careful notes, honest comparisons.

More of a workshop than a gala. Some bottles impress immediately. Others
reveal their character slowly. The goal is always the same: to find
wines that will genuinely enhance your experience - bottles you'll be
glad to see at your door.

**The Value Question**

Beyond the taste, a wine has to make sense for your table. A beautiful
bottle should have a price that matches the experience it provides.

Some wines are lovely but have drifted beyond what the experience
justifies - we appreciate them, but they don't make the cut. Others
offer remarkable quality at a price that feels almost unfair. These
special finds let you explore new regions and varieties with confidence,
knowing the value is real.

The goal isn't to find the lowest-priced wines or the most prestigious
ones. It's to find wines where what's in the glass truly justifies what
you pay, and sometimes, delightfully exceeds it.

**What This Means for You**

The selection you see has already been carefully considered. Every wine
earned its place. Whether you're reaching for a familiar favorite or
trying something new, you're choosing from bottles we believe in.

That's the work we do in the warehouse office, so you can simply enjoy
what arrives. Your collection, curated before you even browse.
