**How Much Presence Does Your Wine Have?**

Dry red wines don't all play the same role in your evening.
**Intensity** describes how much presence and attention a wine asks for.

**The Spectrum of Intensity**

- **Lower Intensity:** These reds are pleasant and easy. They accompany
  your meal without interrupting. You might not think much about the
  wine itself---it's just there, making the evening a little nicer.
  Perfect when conversation, food, or company is the real focus.

- **Medium Intensity:** These wines have presence. You notice them
  between bites. They're engaging enough to appreciate, but not so
  demanding that they take over. A good balance for most dinners.

- **Higher Intensity:** These wines demand attention. Bold flavors, firm
  textures, a finish that lingers. Even with food on the table, the wine
  is a co-star. For evenings when you want the wine itself to be part of
  the event.

**Choosing the Right Role**

Matching the intensity to your occasion is the secret to a great wine
experience:

- **The Casual Evening:** A lighter red lets conversation flow. It's
  there, it's good, but it's not asking you to stop and analyze it.

  - *Try this with:* Light dishes, simple meals, or when the company is
    the main event.

- **The Everyday Dinner:** A medium-intensity red complements your food
  without competing. Enough presence to enjoy, easy enough to not
  overthink.

  - *Try this with:* Pasta, roast chicken, grilled vegetables---most
    weeknight meals.

- **The Wine-Forward Occasion:** A bold red is for when you want to pay
  attention. Maybe it's a special bottle, a celebratory meal, or you
  just want to slow down and taste.

  - *Try this with:* Rich dishes that can stand up to it---or on its
    own, when the wine is the point.

**A Way to Picture It**

Think of it like music. Same song, different settings:

- **Background music at a restaurant** --- Pleasant, but you're focused
  on conversation and food. The music sets a mood without demanding
  attention.

- **Listening at home with good headphones** --- Now you're engaged. You
  notice the details, but you're still relaxed.

- **A small concert venue** --- The music *is* the experience. It fills
  the room. You're there for it.

Wine intensity works the same way. It's not about quality---it's about
how much space the wine takes up in your experience.

**The Intensity Scale**

Each red wine shows an **Intensity rating from 1 to 5**:

- **Levels 1 & 2:** Background role. Easy, pleasant, undemanding.
- **Level 3:** Balanced presence. Noticeable but not overwhelming.
- **Levels 4 & 5:** Spotlight role. Bold, attention-getting, the wine is
  an event.

Explore the spectrum and discover the perfect bottle for every moment.
Whether you want something that fades into the background or a wine that
demands the spotlight, you'll find the right fit.

  set down your glass. This is intensity: the space the wine takes up in
