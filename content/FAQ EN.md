## Choosing Wine

*Not sure what to get? Start here.*

### What is a good wine?

**Short:** If you want another sip after the first, it's a good wine. Taste is personal.

**More:** There's no universal answer because taste is personal. A wine that one person loves might leave another cold. The "best" wine isn't the most expensive or the highest-rated—it's the one that makes you reach for another sip.

Over time, you'll notice patterns in what you enjoy. Maybe you like bolder reds. Maybe you prefer something crisp and refreshing. That's all "knowing about wine" really means—paying attention to what makes you happy.

### What can I bring for dinner?

**Short:** Start with what you know. Don't know much? We can work with that.

**More:** Most people don't know what's being served—and that's fine. Here's how we approach it:

**If you know the menu:** A red for meat, a white for fish or chicken, rosé for anything light. Easy.

**If you don't know the menu:** Think about the occasion. Friday night dinner in winter? A crowd-pleasing red that works with chicken or brisket. Summer afternoon? A crisp white or interesting rosé.

**If you don't know what they like:** A mid-range red with broad appeal is usually safe—something flavorful but not extreme. Most people enjoy a tasty, approachable red even if they "usually drink white."

**Special occasions:** Grandma's 80th birthday? A gentle sparkling wine (maybe slightly sweet, lower alcohol) is festive and easy to enjoy. A dessert wine is almost impossible to argue with—everyone likes something sweet.

**Budget matters:** Tell us what you want to spend. We'll find the best bottle at that price.

The truth is, guessing isn't that risky. Time of day, season, and occasion give you plenty of clues. And showing up with wine is always appreciated.

### What wine goes with my dinner tonight?

**Short:** Tell us what you're making. Or tell us your budget and we'll suggest something versatile.

**More:** If you know what you're cooking, pairing is straightforward:

- **Chicken, fish, salads** → White or light rosé
- **Pasta with red sauce, pizza** → Medium red
- **Steak, lamb, hearty stews** → Bolder red
- **Spicy food** → Something smooth and mellow (not too crisp—acidity amplifies heat)
- **Not sure yet** → A versatile medium-bodied red works with most things

If you don't know what you want and can't describe what you've liked before, start with your budget. We'll find something approachable that's hard to go wrong with—a crowd-pleaser for your table of one (or two, or four).

### What can I serve at the event?

**Short:** Think about the weather, the crowd, and the food. Context matters more than labels.

**More:** The right wine depends on the moment:

- **Weather & time** — Hot summer afternoon calls for something cold and refreshing—a crisp white or chilled rosé. Winter evening? A warming red feels right.
- **The food** — Match the wine's weight to the food. Light dishes (salads, fish) want lighter wines. Heavier dishes (stews, grilled meats) can handle bolder wines.
- **The crowd** — Mixed group or unsure of tastes? Go for something approachable with broad appeal. Wine enthusiasts coming? You can be more adventurous.

When in doubt, a friendly mid-range wine that isn't too extreme in any direction usually pleases everyone.

### What makes a nice gift?

**Short:** Something interesting they wouldn't buy themselves. We can suggest based on their taste.

**More:** The best wine gifts are bottles the recipient wouldn't necessarily pick on their own—something that introduces them to a new experience. If you know their preferences (bold reds? crisp whites?), we can suggest something that fits their taste while still being a discovery.

Our gift options include packaging and delivery anywhere in Israel.

### What's the difference between your reds?

**Short:** Some are bold and powerful, others are gentle and easy-drinking. Neither is better—it depends on what you're in the mood for.

**More:** Red wines range across a spectrum:

- **Light and easy** — Smooth, fruity, doesn't demand attention. Good for casual evenings, lighter food, or when you just want something pleasant without thinking too hard.
- **Medium-bodied** — More presence, more flavor, but still approachable. Works with most meals. The everyday sweet spot.
- **Bold and powerful** — Rich, full, coats your mouth. Best with hearty food or when the wine itself is the event.

You'll also notice some reds taste like one clear thing (usually fruit), while others have layers—fruit, then spice, then earth. Simple wines are refreshing. Complex wines reward attention. Both are good.

### What's the difference between your whites?

**Short:** Some are crisp and refreshing, others are smooth and mellow. Some taste like one thing, others have layers.

**More:** White wines (and rosés) vary mainly in two ways:

- **Brightness** — Crisp, zesty whites make your mouth water and feel refreshing. Smooth, mellow whites are softer and rounder. Both are good—crisp wines cut through rich food, while mellow wines pair better with spicy dishes.
- **Simplicity vs depth** — Some whites taste like one clean thing (citrus, green apple). Others have more going on—maybe some tropical fruit, a hint of flowers, a mineral edge.

Serve whites cold. Temperature makes a huge difference—too warm and they taste flat.

### I don't know anything about wine. Where do I start?

**Short:** Tell us your budget and the occasion. We'll take it from there.

**More:** You don't need to know anything about wine to get something good. Here's what helps us help you:

- **Budget** — What do you want to spend? We'll find the best bottle at that price.
- **Occasion** — Weeknight dinner? Special celebration? Casual hangout? This tells us a lot.
- **Any preferences** — Even vague ones help. "I think I liked something red once" is a start. "I don't like sweet wine" is useful too.

If you truly have no idea, we'll suggest something approachable with broad appeal—a friendly wine that most people enjoy. Try it. If you want another sip, we're on the right track. If not, tell us what you didn't like and we'll adjust.

### What do wine terms like "dry," "body," and "tannins" mean?

**Short:** Common terms explained simply—no jargon required.

**More:** A few terms you might hear:

- **Dry** — Not sweet. Most table wines are dry. "Dry" doesn't mean the wine dries out your mouth (that's tannins).
- **Sweet** — Has noticeable sugar. Dessert wines are sweet. Some whites have a touch of sweetness.
- **Body** — How heavy the wine feels in your mouth. Light-bodied is like skim milk, full-bodied is like whole milk.
- **Tannins** — That slightly drying, gripping sensation in red wines (like strong tea). Some reds have more, some less.
- **Crisp/Bright** — Refreshing acidity that makes your mouth water. Common in white wines.
- **Oaky** — Flavors from aging in oak barrels—vanilla, toast, spice. Some wines have it, some don't.
- **Fruity** — Tastes like fruit (berries, citrus, stone fruit). Most wines are fruity to some degree.

You don't need to memorize these. But if you see them on a label or hear them in conversation, now you know.

## Trust & Quality

*Can you trust us? Is this worth the money?*

### How do you choose your wines?

**Short:** Every vintage is tasted before it's listed. Not every bottle—every vintage.

**More:** Wine is an agricultural product. The same label can taste different year to year. So we taste every vintage fresh—new arrivals, returning favorites, everything.

Tastings happen in the warehouse office, late morning when the palate is freshest. We're looking for wines that deliver quality at their price point. Beautiful bottles that cost more than the experience justifies don't make the cut. Special finds that over-deliver? Those earn a spot.

The selection you see has already been carefully considered.

### Who is behind JLM Wines?

**Short:** Evyatar—10+ years running the wine shop in Katamon, now growing grapes in Nokdim.

**More:** Evyatar started in wine because he needed a job. He stayed because he couldn't stop asking questions.

For over a decade, he's run the wine shop in Katamon—learning from customers, tasting everything, finding bottles worth recommending. That same approach drives jlmwines.com.

When he's not in the shop, he's in Nokdim growing grapes (Malbec, Cabernet, Syrah, and more), or in the cellar making wine, or at a table enjoying both.

### Is expensive wine actually better?

**Short:** Not always. We evaluate at every price point. A ₪50 bottle has to deliver ₪50 value.

**More:** In one famous study, wine judges rated the same wine from the same bottle three times—and scores varied by ±4 points. Expert ratings are surprisingly inconsistent.

Higher prices often buy real things: better grapes, more attention, quality oak aging. But reputation and price don't guarantee you'll enjoy what's in the glass.

We evaluate wines at every price point with the same critical eye. A ₪50 bottle has to deliver a ₪50 experience. A ₪150 bottle has to justify that price in the glass—not just on the label.

### What if I don't like a wine?

**Short:** Let us know. We'll replace it or credit your account.

**More:** If something's wrong with a bottle—or it's just not what you expected—contact us. We'll make it right, either with a replacement or a credit to your account.

We put our reputation on every bottle we sell. If you're not happy, we want to know.

### Are your wines kosher?

**Short:** Yes. Every wine we carry is certified kosher. Each product page shows the certification.

**More:** All wines on jlmwines.com are certified kosher. You'll find the specific certification (hechsher) noted on each product page.

---

### What are Value Bundles?

**Short:** Our favorite finds at prices that over-deliver. Wines where what's in the glass exceeds what you pay.

**More:** Value Bundles are collections built around wines that punch above their weight—bottles where the quality genuinely exceeds what the price suggests.

These aren't leftovers or wines we're trying to move. They're discoveries we're excited about, offered at prices that feel almost unfair.

## Practical Help

*You bought it—now what?*

### How should I store my wine?

**Short:** Cool, dark, steady temperature. An interior closet works fine.

**More:** Wine doesn't need a fancy cellar, but it does need protection from:

- **Heat** — Keep it away from the kitchen, appliances, and sunny windows
- **Light** — Store in a dark place
- **Temperature swings** — Find somewhere with steady temperature year-round

An interior cabinet or closet that feels cool to the touch is usually perfect. Store bottles on their side to keep corks moist.

### What temperature should I serve wine?

**Short:** Reds: slightly cooler than room temp. Whites: fridge cold.

**More:** Temperature makes a big difference:

- **Reds** — Slightly cooler than room temperature. If your house is warm, put the bottle in the fridge for 15 minutes before opening.
- **Whites & Rosés** — Serve chilled. Fridge temperature is right.
- **Sparkling** — Very cold.

Too warm and wine tastes flat and boozy. Too cold and you miss the flavors.

---

### Should I let the wine breathe?

**Short:** Check the product page or packing slip. We note it when it helps.

**More:** Some wines benefit from air before serving—it softens the texture and opens up the aromas. But most wines we sell are ready to enjoy straight from the bottle.

When decanting helps, we note it on the product page and your packing slip:
- **Young reds:** 30-60 minutes
- **Mature reds:** 1-2 hours

No note? Just pour and enjoy.

### How do I save an open bottle?

**Short:** Vacuum pump + refrigerator—even for reds.

**More:** Once opened, wine starts to change. To slow it down:

1. **Vacuum pump** — Removes air from the bottle and creates a seal
2. **Refrigerator** — Acts like a "pause button" for the wine's development

Yes, put reds in the fridge too. Just let them warm up a bit before your next pour.

### What glass should I use?

**Short:** Any glass with a tapered bowl. Pour to 1/3 full.

**More:** You don't need expensive crystal. A simple glass with a bowl that narrows at the top works well—it concentrates the aromas.

**The 1/3 rule:** Pour to the widest point of the bowl (about one-third full). This gives the wine room to swirl and release its scents.

Hold by the stem to keep your hand from warming the wine—unless it's too cold, in which case, cup away.
