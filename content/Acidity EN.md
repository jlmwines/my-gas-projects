**Bright and Fresh or Mellow Comfort?**

When people describe a wine as "crisp," "zippy," or "refreshing,"
they're usually talking about **Acidity**. It's what gives a wine its
sense of brightness, freshness, and sparkle.

**The Spectrum of Acidity**

- **Lower Acidity:** These wines feel rounded and gentle on your tongue.
  They focus on fruit and floral aromas rather than crispness. Smooth,
  soft, no sharp edges. (Look for **1 or 2** on the scale.)

  - *Best for:* Spicy food---high acidity can amplify heat, so a softer
    wine provides a smooth counterpoint. Also pairs well with delicate
    dishes that don't need extra "edge."

- **Medium Acidity:** These wines find the sweet spot---natural, true,
  neither too soft nor too sharp. Fresh and clean without being
  aggressive. (Look for **3** on the scale.)

  - *Best for:* A wide variety of everyday meals. These are the
    all-rounders that work with most dishes.

- **Higher Acidity:** These wines have crisp definition and refreshing
  highlights. They make your mouth water and leave a clean, zesty
  finish. Vibrant and alive. (Look for **4 or 5** on the scale.)

  - *Best for:* Rich, creamy dishes where the brightness cuts through
    the fat. Also great with fried food, tangy sauces, or anything that
    benefits from a refreshing contrast.

**How to Notice Brightness**

The next time you take a sip of white or rosé, pay attention to the
sensation on your tongue:

- **Higher Acidity** creates a pleasant tingle, especially on the sides
  of your mouth. Your mouth waters more. There's a crispness, a sparkle.

- **Lower Acidity** feels soft and smooth---no sharpness, just gentle
  fruit. Rounded and mellow.

**A Way to Picture It**

Think of it like music---same song, same volume, same number of
musicians, but different tonal quality:

- **Warm and mellow** --- Cello, bass, soft piano. The sound is smooth,
  rounded, no sharp edges. It wraps around you.

- **Balanced and clear** --- A mix of warm and bright tones. Natural,
  true, easy to listen to.

- **Bright and sparkling** --- Violin, flute, crisp cymbal. The sound
  has edge, definition, sparkle. It cuts through and wakes you up.

Wine acidity works the same way. It's what makes your mouth water, keeps
a wine from tasting "flat," and gives it that refreshing quality.

**The Acidity Scale**

Each white and rosé shows an **Acidity rating from 1 to 5**:

- **Levels 1 & 2:** Warm and mellow. Soft, smooth, gentle.
- **Level 3:** Clear and balanced. Fresh without being sharp.
- **Levels 4 & 5:** Bright and sparkling. Crisp, zesty, vibrant.
