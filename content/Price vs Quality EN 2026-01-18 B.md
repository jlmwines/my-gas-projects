**When to Spend More (And When Not To)**

We've all wondered: **Is the ₪150 bottle actually better than the ₪50 one?**

Here's the honest answer: it depends entirely on you.

**Start With What You Enjoy**

Before thinking about price, think about what you like. Do you enjoy bold, intense wines? Light and refreshing ones? Something in between?

Once you know what qualities you enjoy, the question becomes: do you want a deeper experience of those qualities? If yes, spending more can genuinely enhance what you already love. If not, there's no reason to.

**A Way to Think About It**

If you need to know the time, most watches do the job. An inexpensive watch and a Rolex both tell time equally well. But if you take joy in the artistry and precision of watchmaking, an expensive watch brings something a lower-priced one can't.

Same with music. If you like singing along to songs you enjoy, you probably don't need high-end speakers. But if you're a devoted fan of a specific genre, you might spend real money to see your favorite artist perform live—and it's worth every shekel.

Wine works the same way. Each vintage of each wine is a unique expression. If that idea excites you—if you want to taste the difference between one year and the next, one vineyard and another—then it's worth spending more. If you just want something good to drink, you don't need to.

**What Quality Actually Means**

When you pay more for wine, you're paying for real things:

- **In the vineyard:** Grapes grown and nurtured specifically for the style of wine they'll become. More rigorous sorting. Harvest timing down to the day.

- **In the winery:** Specialized equipment to handle grapes gently at every stage. Precise fermentation temperatures. A sensitive approach to each batch. The choice of barrels, bottles, even closures.

The result is a wine with more distinct qualities—more layers, more personality, more to discover. But "more" only matters if it's more of what you enjoy.

**Why Your Taste Matters More Than Expert Scores**

Here's something worth knowing: wine expert ratings are far less reliable than you'd think.

In a [study of California State Fair judges](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2009/02/01/wine-judges-fail-taste-test/), the same judge tasting the same wine three times—from the same bottle—gave ratings that varied by ±4 points. A wine scored 91 one moment might get an 87 or 95 the next. Only 1 in 10 judges rated consistently. And across competitions? 99% of wines that won gold at one event received no award at another.

Then there's the famous [1976 blind tasting in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)). French experts—the best in the business—were asked to rate French wines against California wines they'd never heard of. The California wines won. Both red and white. One French judge reportedly tried to get her scorecard back so no one would see what she'd written.

The point isn't that experts are useless or that expensive wines are bad. It's that reputation and price don't guarantee *you'll* enjoy what's in the glass. Your own taste is the only reliable guide.

**When to Spend More**

- You've found qualities you love and want to experience them more deeply
- You want a wine with layers that unfold over the evening
- You're curious about what makes one vintage different from another
- You want to slow down and really pay attention to what's in your glass

**When Not To**

- You haven't yet discovered what you enjoy—explore at lower prices first
- Someone else (a critic, a friend, a list) says it's great, but you don't know if it's great *for you*
- The wine is playing a supporting role to food or conversation
- You'd rather discover three good bottles than one expensive one

**Our Role in This**

We taste every wine we sell. Not to tell you what's "best"—but to make sure that whatever you choose, at whatever price, delivers what it promises.

A ₪50 bottle has to be a genuinely good ₪50 experience. A ₪150 bottle has to justify that price in the glass, not just on the label. Our reputation is on every packing slip.

When you're ready to explore deeper, we're here to guide you toward wines that reward the attention. When you want something easy and reliable, we have that too. Both are valid. Both are good.

"Should you spend more on wine? It depends on what you enjoy—not what experts say. Research shows even top judges are wildly inconsistent. Here's how to decide what's worth it for you."

**The ₪50 vs. ₪150 Question**

If you need to know the time, any watch works. But if you love the artistry of watchmaking, you'll pay for a better one.

Wine is the same. Spending more makes sense when you want a deeper experience of what you already enjoy—not because someone said it's "better."

(Fun fact: in one study, wine judges scored the same wine ±4 points... from the same bottle.)
