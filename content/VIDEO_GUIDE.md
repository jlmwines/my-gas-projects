# JLM Wines Video Production Guide

Video framework for YouTube content accompanying blog posts, FAQ, and educational content.

---

## Overview

### Video Types

| Type | Length | Platform | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Blog embed** | 3-4 min | YouTube (embedded) | Full topic explanation |
| **Short-form** | 15-60s | Reels/TikTok/Shorts | Social teasers, single concept |
| **B-roll clips** | 5-15s | Any | Visual support, transitions |

### Production Approach: Hybrid

- **Evyatar on camera** — Shot in shop (wine shelves background)
- **B-roll** — Mix of stock video, AI-generated, and real footage
- **Editor** — Canva video editor
- **AI generation** — Canva Magic Media for custom b-roll

---

## Language Strategy

Separate videos for Hebrew and English.

| Element | Hebrew | English |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Script | Translated, same structure | Translated, same structure |
| Evyatar footage | Unique | Unique |
| Voiceover | Unique | Unique |
| Intro/end cards | Hebrew text | English text |
| Subscribe CTA | Hebrew | English |
| B-roll | **Shared** | **Shared** |
| Music | **Shared** | **Shared** |

Each language has its own YouTube playlist.

## Video Structure (3-4 minutes)

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0:00-0:15 | Question/problem, draw them in |
| **Context** | 0:15-0:45 | Why this matters |
| **Main content** | 0:45-2:30 | The explanation, tips, insights |
| **Subscribe CTA** | 2:30-2:40 | Brief verbal ask + button |
| **Wrap-up** | 2:40-3:15 | Summary, practical takeaway |
| **End card** | 3:15-3:30 | Branding, next video suggestion |

---

## Consistent Elements

### Intro (First 3 seconds)

**Style:** Jump straight in — no intro animation

- Evyatar starts talking immediately with the hook
- JLM logo appears as small watermark (corner)
- Lower third fades in at 3-4 seconds

**Why:** YouTube algorithm measures retention from second 1. Slow intros kill videos.

**Example opening:**
> "What makes a wine good? Forget everything you've heard about ratings and regions. There's only one rule that matters..."

---

### Lower Third (Speaker ID)

When Evyatar appears on camera:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Evyatar                 │
│ JLM Wines               │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

- Clean, minimal design
- Gold accent line (matches brand)
- Appears at 3-4 seconds, fades after 4 seconds
- Reappears briefly if returning from long b-roll segment

---

### Subscribe CTA

**Placement:** Mid-roll (around 60-90 seconds)

**Style:** Verbal + animated overlay

- Evyatar says naturally: "If this is helpful, subscribe — I share new videos every week"
- Animated subscribe button appears on screen during verbal CTA
- Keep under 5 seconds, then back to content

**Avoid:** "Like and subscribe and hit the bell" — sounds scripted

---

### End Card (Last 10-15 seconds)

**Elements:**
- "Wine Talk — from Evyatar" branding
- Subscribe button (YouTube end screen clickable)
- Next video suggestion
- Website URL: jlmwines.com

**Style:** Clean, matches overall warm aesthetic

---

### Music

**Style:** Throughout video, ducked during speech

| Segment | Music Level |
|---------|-------------|
| During Evyatar talking | Low (barely audible) |
| During b-roll/transitions | Medium |
| Intro/outro moments | Slightly higher |

**Music type:** Warm acoustic or light jazz — European café feel. Not corporate or upbeat pop.

**Technical:** Use Canva's audio ducking feature to automatically lower music during speech.

---

## B-Roll Strategy

### Sources (Layered Mix)

| Use Case | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Shop, Evyatar, actual products | Real footage |
| Generic wine visuals (pour, swirl, glasses) | Canva stock video |
| Concept visuals (metaphors) | Photorealistic AI |
| Mood/atmosphere | Stock or AI |

### AI B-Roll Prompt Formula (Photorealistic)

```
Cinematic close-up of [SUBJECT], warm natural lighting, shallow depth of field, subtle slow motion, 5 seconds
```

**Examples:**
```
Cinematic close-up of red wine being poured into glass, warm natural lighting, shallow depth of field, subtle slow motion
```
```
Cinematic close-up of wine bottles on wooden shelf, soft ambient lighting, gentle camera movement
```
```
Cinematic close-up of wine glass on table with soft candlelight, warm tones, subtle movement
```

### Visual Consistency

Keep all footage (stock, AI, real) consistent through:

- **Color grading** — Apply same warm tone filter in Canva editor
- **Lighting feel** — Always warm, golden, never clinical/bright
- **Motion** — Slow, gentle movement (no fast cuts for b-roll)

---

## Brand Elements

### Colors
- **Primary:** Gold, black, white
- **Text overlays:** White with subtle shadow (readability)
- **Accent/CTA:** Gold highlights

### Typography
- Match website header font or use clean sans-serif for video readability
- Ensure legibility on mobile (not too small)

### Logo Watermark
- Small JLM logo in corner
- Semi-transparent
- Present throughout video

---

## Thumbnail Style

- Consistent across all videos
- Evyatar's face (builds recognition)
- Large readable text (3-4 words max)
- Warm color palette
- Wine element visible
