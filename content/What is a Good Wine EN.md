**You Already Know What Good Wine Is**

The world of wine is vast, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the
thousands of choices available. But one question often arises: *What
makes a wine "good"?* At JLM Wines, we subscribe to a rule famously set
by a Manhattan restaurateur: **If after the first sip, you want another
sip, it's a good wine.** Since taste is personal, the "best" wine isn't
the most expensive one---it's the one that matches your mood and your
palate. To help you find your next favorite bottle, we look at three
simple concepts that define how a wine feels in your mouth.

**How to Find Your Style**

When you are trying to decide why you liked a certain bottle (or why you
didn't), think about these three characteristics:

- **Intensity (The Volume):** Some wines are quiet and delicate, while
  others are loud and bold. Think of this as the "weight" of the wine.
  Does it coat your mouth with deep, dark fruit flavors, or does it feel
  light and effortless?

- **Complexity (The Story):** A simple wine tastes like one thing
  (usually fruit) from start to finish. A complex wine tells a longer
  story---you might taste fruit at first, followed by a hint of
  earthiness, spice, or even a woody note on the finish.

- **Acidity (The Refreshment):** Mostly found in whites and rosés, this
  is that mouth-watering, "crisp" feeling. It's what makes a wine feel
  bright and refreshing rather than flat or heavy.

**Three Things That Change the Experience**

Once you know if you prefer a "loud" wine or a "crisp" one, consider
these factors:

1.  **Context Matters:** A bold, intense red that feels heavy on a hot
    afternoon might be absolutely perfect when paired with a rich,
    savory dinner. The right setting can make a good wine feel great.

2.  **The Mystery of the Vintage:** Because wine comes from nature, it
    changes every year. A favorite wine might be bright and acidic one
    year, and more mellow the next, depending on the sun and rain. This
    variation is part of the fun---every bottle is a snapshot of a
    specific moment in time.

3.  **Trust Your Source:** You shouldn't have to be an expert to get a
    great bottle. Having a vendor who vets every vintage ensures that
    the "hard work" is already done.

sip, it's a winner. From understanding the 'volume' of a red to the
'refreshment' of a white, here is our understated guide to finding your
next favorite bottle without the jargon."

**The Second Sip Rule**

The world of wine can feel like a maze of technical terms and high
prices. But we have a simpler way to choose: If you finish your first
glass and immediately want a second, you've found a good wine.

On the blog today, we're breaking down the three simple
things---Intensity, Complexity, and Acidity---that help you figure out
*why* you like what you like. No fancy vocabulary needed. \[Link\]

- **Body:** A Manhattan restaurateur had a rule: if after the first sip,
  you want another sip, it's a good wine. That's it. No scores, no
  vintage charts, no sommelier vocabulary. But understanding *why* you
  like a wine helps you find more like it. Three things to notice:
  Intensity (is it background music or a concert?), Complexity (one
  clear flavor or layers unfolding?), and Acidity (crisp and refreshing
  or smooth and mellow?). None of these makes a wine "better"---they
  just help you match the bottle to your mood.
