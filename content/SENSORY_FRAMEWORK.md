# JLM Wines: Sensory Framework

This is the internal reference for describing wine characteristics consistently. These metaphors help us write clear, relatable descriptions — customers don't need to learn this system.

**Core idea:** Every wine moves along three independent dimensions. They're separate — a wine can be any combination.

---

## The Three Dimensions

### 1. INTENSITY — The Volume

*How much attention does the wine ask for?*

Think of it like the same song at different volumes:
- **Low:** Background music at a restaurant — pleasant, sets the mood, doesn't demand focus
- **Medium:** Listening at home with headphones — you're engaged, you notice things
- **High:** Small concert venue — the music *is* the experience, it commands attention

**Why it matters:** Match the wine's role to your evening. A background wine lets conversation flow. A spotlight wine is the event itself. You can eat in all settings—but the wine's role changes.

*Visual alternative:* Image on a screen — thumbnail in corner → expanded → full screen.

| Level | In The Glass | Pairs With |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Low (1-2) | Light, gentle, easy-drinking | Delicate dishes, light salads, simple fish |
| Medium (3) | Clear presence, noticeable but not overwhelming | Versatile — works with most everyday meals |
| High (4-5) | Bold, powerful, coats the mouth | Rich meats, hearty stews, bold flavors |

### 2. COMPLEXITY — The Number of Instruments

*How much is happening? How many different things can you notice?*

Think of it like the same song played by different groups:
- **Low:** Solo or duet — one clear melody, direct and easy to follow
- **Medium:** Small ensemble — main melody plus harmony and counterpoint
- **High:** Full orchestra — layers of sound that reveal more each time you listen

**Why it matters:** Neither is better. Simple wines are refreshing and easy. Complex wines reward attention and pair well with layered dishes.

*Visual alternative:* Simple sketch → detailed photo → intricate mosaic.

| Level | In The Glass | Experience |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Low (1-2) | One clear flavor — usually fruit | Easy to enjoy, no overthinking needed |
| Medium (3) | Main flavor plus secondary notes (spice, flowers) | More to discover, but still approachable |
| High (4-5) | Layers that unfold — fruit, earth, spice, oak, herbs | Evolving journey from first sip to finish |

### 3. ACIDITY — The Brightness / Tone

*How bright and sharp is the wine? How much sparkle and definition?*

Think of it like the same song with different tonal quality:
- **Low:** Warm and mellow — cello, bass, soft piano. Smooth, rounded, no sharp edges
- **Medium:** Clear and balanced — mix of warm and bright tones. Natural, true
- **High:** Bright and sparkling — violin, flute, crisp cymbal. Edge, definition, sparkle

**Why it matters for pairing:** Brightness cuts through richness. A bright wine refreshes the palate between bites of creamy or fatty food. A soft wine complements delicate or spicy dishes without adding more "edge."

*Visual alternative:* Soft warm photo → clear balanced → bright high-contrast.

| Level | In The Glass | Pairs With |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Low (1-2) | Smooth, round, soft mouthfeel | Spicy food (won't amplify the heat), delicate dishes |
| Medium (3) | Fresh, balanced, clean finish | Versatile — everyday meals |
| High (4-5) | Crisp, mouth-watering, zesty | Rich/creamy dishes (cuts through fat), fried food |

## How They Work Together

The three dimensions are independent. Examples:

| Wine Style | Intensity | Complexity | Acidity |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Light summer white | Low | Low | High |
| Rich oaked Chardonnay | Medium | High | Low |
| Bold Cabernet | High | High | Medium |
| Easy-drinking red | Low | Low | Medium |

**No combination is "better."** It's about matching the wine to the moment, the food, and the person.

## Using This Framework

**In product descriptions:** Use natural language, not the framework terminology.
- Not: "Intensity 4, Complexity 3"
- Yes: "Bold and powerful, with layers of dark fruit and spice"

**In blog content:** The metaphors (volume, detail, brightness) can help explain concepts without jargon.

**On packing slips:** Lead with practical info:
1. Pairing suggestions (simple)
2. Decanting recommendation (if relevant)
3. Then characteristics (Intensity/Complexity/Acidity)
