**Getting the Best from Every Bottle**

Wine is a living, delicate creation. To make sure you experience the
full "orchestra" of intensity and all the layers of complexity we've
talked about, a little bit of care goes a long way. This guide covers
the basics---from the moment your box arrives to the final sip.

**Storage: Finding the "Coolest Spot"**

Wine doesn't like light, heat, or vibration. You don't need a fancy
cellar, but you do need to avoid the kitchen counter or anywhere near a
window.

- **The Goal:** A cool, dark place with a steady temperature.

- **The JLM Tip:** Look for an interior cabinet or a closet far away
  from doors and appliances. If it feels cool to your touch year-round,
  it's a good home for your wine.

**Opening: Finesse Over Force**

Opening a bottle is an exciting moment. To keep the cork intact:

1.  Use the blade of your opener to cut the foil cap cleanly.

2.  Center your opener and twist it into the cork.

3.  **The Secret:** Twist the opener, not the bottle. Gently lift the
    cork out to avoid any breakage.

**Decanting: When It Helps**

Some wines benefit from a little air before serving. Pouring the wine
into a decanter or glass pitcher exposes it to oxygen, which can help
release aromas and soften the texture.

Most wines we sell are ready to enjoy straight from the bottle. When
decanting is recommended, we note it on the product page and your
packing slip. If you see the suggestion:

- **Young Reds:** Give them **30--60 minutes**. This softens the wine
  and brings the fruit flavors forward.

- **Mature Reds:** These might need **1--2 hours** to wake up the subtle
  notes that have developed over years of aging.

No decanting note? Just pour and enjoy.

**Serving: Temperature & Glassware**

Temperature is the most common mistake people make. If a wine is too
warm, it tastes boozy; if it's too cold, you can't taste the complexity.

- **Reds:** Serve **slightly cooler than room temperature**. If your
  house is warm, put the red in the fridge for 15 minutes before
  opening.

- **Whites:** Serve **chilled**.

- **Sparkling:** Serve **very chilled**.

**The Glass:** You don't need expensive crystals. A simple glass with a
tapered bowl works best.

- **The 1/3 Rule:** Pour your wine to the widest point of the bowl
  (about one-third full). This gives the wine room to swirl and release
  its scents.

- **The Stem:** Hold the glass by the stem. This keeps your hands from
  warming up the wine (unless it's a bit too cold, in which case,
  cupping the bowl is perfectly fine!).

**Saving Some for Later**

Once opened, wine begins to change. If you don't finish the bottle, you
have two main tools:

1.  **Vacuum Pumps:** These remove the air from the bottle and create a
    seal, slowing down the fading of the flavor.

2.  **Refrigeration:** Always put opened wine (even red!) in the fridge.
    It acts like a "pause button" for the wine's development. Just
    remember to let the reds warm up slightly before you drink them the
    next day.

- **Preview:** And one trick that saves an open bottle for days.
- **Body:** Temperature is the biggest mistake. Too warm, and wine tastes
  boozy. Too cold, and you miss the complexity. Reds should be slightly
  cooler than room temperature---if your house is warm, 15 minutes in
  the fridge before opening. Whites should be fridge-cold. The second
  mistake: storing wine near heat or light. Find an interior cabinet
  that stays cool year-round. The third: letting open wine go to waste.
  A vacuum pump removes air; the fridge slows oxidation. Even reds go in
  the fridge once opened---just let them warm up before the next pour.
