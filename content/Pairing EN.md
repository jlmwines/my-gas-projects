**2 Simple Secrets to Pairing Food and Wine**

Many people feel they need a degree in culinary arts to pair wine with
food. It should be as simple as choosing a side dish.

Forget the technical rules. Here are two simple ways to think about your
glass and your plate.

**Secret 1: Choose Your Pairing Style**

Instead of memorizing flavor profiles, just ask yourself how you want
the tastes to interact:

- **Harmonizing:** The wine and food share the same energy. A crisp,
  bright white with grilled fish---both are light and refreshing. They
  complement each other naturally, each reinforcing the other.

- **Contrasting:** The wine does what the food cannot. A bold red with a
  rich, fatty steak---the wine's presence cuts through the richness,
  refreshing your palate between bites. Both the food and wine are
  enhanced by the other.

**Secret 2: Know Your Food Type**

Almost every dish fits into one of four groups. Once you know which one
you're serving, the wine choice becomes clear.

**Mild**

Light foods like soft cheeses, white fish, lightly seasoned poultry, or
pasta in a light sauce.

*What works:* A fresh white wine with crisp acidity and delicate fruit
flavors. The wine harmonizes with the gentle flavors without
overwhelming them.

**Rich**

Heavier flavors like salmon, red meats, fattier foods, hard cheeses, or
anything with butter and cream.

*What works:* A medium-intensity red with rich fruit and smooth texture.
Or a white with higher acidity to cut through the richness---the
brightness acts like a palate cleanser between bites.

**Intense**

Dishes with big personalities---spicy curries, heavy seasonings, bold
garlic, or strong flavors that announce themselves.

*What works:* A complex red with bold fruit can stand up to the
intensity. But here's the important exception: for spicy heat, choose
**lower acidity**. High-acid wines amplify the burn, while a softer,
warmer-toned wine provides a cooling counterpoint.

**Sweet**

Desserts, pastries, or savory dishes with sweet glazes, sauces, or fruit
components.

*What works:* A wine with some fruity sweetness of its own. The
sweetness harmonizes rather than clashes---dry wines can taste bitter
against sweet food.

**Using the Scales**

Each wine on our site shows simple 1-5 scales. Here's how to use them:

**For Red Wines (Intensity & Complexity)**

- **Rich foods** love higher **Intensity**---a bold dish needs a wine
  that won't fade into the background.
- **Intense dishes** pair well with higher **Complexity**---more layers
  in the wine means more flavors to engage with the dish's boldness.

**For White & Rosé Wines (Complexity & Acidity)**

- **Rich or creamy dishes** pair with higher **Acidity**---brightness
  cuts through fat and keeps the meal feeling fresh.
- **Spicy foods** need **lower Acidity**---high-acid wines amplify heat,
  while softer wines provide relief.

**Where to Find Pairing Help**

You don't have to memorize any of this. Both product pages and your
packing slip show pairing suggestions---Harmonize or Contrast, and which
food types work best.

**The Golden Rule**

These are just suggestions. If you love a bold red with your salad, then
it's a good pairing. The system is here to help you move from "I'm not
sure" to "I'll try that" with confidence.

- **Body:** Forget technical rules. Two questions are all you need.
  First: harmonize or contrast? A light white with grilled fish is
  harmony---both are delicate, each reinforces the other. A bold red
  with fatty steak is contrast---the wine cuts through richness,
  refreshing your palate between bites. Second: what type of dish?
  Mild foods want fresh, light wines. Rich foods want either bold reds
  or high-acidity whites that act as palate cleansers. Spicy foods need
  lower acidity---high-acid wines amplify heat. Sweet dishes pair with
  fruity wines. That's it. The system is on every packing slip.

Rich wants bold or high-acid. Spicy needs low acid (high acid amplifies
heat). Sweet pairs with fruity. That's the whole system.
