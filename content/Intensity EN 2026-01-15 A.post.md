<p>Dry red wines don't all play the same role in your evening. <strong>Intensity</strong> describes how much presence and attention a wine asks for.</p>

<h2>Understanding The Spectrum of Intensity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:columns -->
<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Lower Intensity:</strong> These reds are pleasant and easy going. They accompany your meal without interrupting. You might not think much about the wine itself—it's just there, making the evening a little nicer. Perfect when conversation, food, or company is the real focus. There's often beauty and complexity here too, but appreciating it asks you to slow down and notice the details.</li><li><strong>Medium Intensity:</strong> These wines have presence. You notice them between bites. They're engaging enough to appreciate, but not so demanding that they take over. A good balance for most.</li><li><strong>Higher Intensity:</strong> These wines demand attention. Bold flavors, firm textures, a finish that lingers. Even with food on the table, the wine is a co-star. For evenings when you want the wine itself to be part of the event.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people find they settle into a preferred intensity for a while - then it may shift. This is both personal and natural. It also follows the seasons: summer often calls for lighter, fresher experiences, while winter draws us toward deeper, more comforting flavors. The same pattern shows up in our food choices.</p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Role</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matching the intensity to your occasion is the secret to a great wine experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>The Casual Evening:</strong> A lighter red lets conversation flow. It's there, it's good, but it's not asking you to stop and analyze it.</li><li><em>Try this with:</em> Light dishes, simple meals, or when the company is the main event.</li><li><strong>The Everyday Dinner:</strong> A medium-intensity red complements your food without competing. Enough presence to enjoy, easy enough to engage with but does not take over.</li><li><em>Try this with:</em> Pasta, roast chicken, grilled vegetables—most weeknight meals.</li><li><strong>The Wine-Forward Occasion:</strong> A bold red is for when you want to pay attention. Maybe it's a special bottle, a celebratory meal, or you just want to slow down and taste.</li><li><em>Try this with:</em> Rich dishes that can stand up to it—or on its own, when the wine is the point.</li></ul>

<h3>A Way to Picture It</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of it like music—specifically, the volume at which the music is played.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every wine comes with its own volume setting. A lower-intensity wine plays quietly; a higher-intensity wine plays loud. You don't control the dial—the wine does.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your job is to match the setting to the volume:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Put a quiet wine in the spotlight and it might feel thin, but if it is complex and nuanced, this will be where it shines.. Put a loud wine in the background and it overwhelms everything else. Neither is wrong—just mismatched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intensity isn't about quality. It's about how much space the wine takes up in your experience, and choosing the right moment for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column -->

<!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A quiet song belongs in an intimate space—background at dinner, conversation taking the lead.</li><li>A louder song needs room to fill—an evening where you're paying attention, where the wine is part of the event.</li></ul>

<h2>The Intensity Scale</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:columns -->
<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each red wine shows an <strong>Intensity rating from 1 to 5</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Levels 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Background role. Easy, pleasant, undemanding.</li><li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Balanced presence. Noticeable but not overwhelming.</li><li><strong>Levels 4 &amp; 5:</strong> Spotlight role. Bold, attention-getting, the wine is an event.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Explore the spectrum and discover the perfect bottle for every moment. Whether you want something that fades into the background or a wine that demands the spotlight, you'll find the right fit.</p>
