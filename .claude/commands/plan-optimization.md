description: Plan next resource optimization phase
---

Help me plan the next resource optimization phase for jlmops:

1. Review current resource usage patterns (check for `getDataRange().getValues()` calls)
2. Identify top resource-consuming operations
3. Propose optimization strategies ranked by:
   - Resource savings potential (Google Sheets API calls, execution time)
   - Implementation complexity
   - Risk level
4. Create a prioritized action plan
5. Estimate impact on performance metrics

Reference `.claude/project-context.md` for current state and past optimizations.
