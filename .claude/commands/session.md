description: Save session, update docs, and sync with git
---

Please help me close the current session properly:

1. **Review Session Accomplishments:**
   - What we've accomplished in this session
   - Resource savings achieved
   - Modified files

2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Review and update `jlmops/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` if needed
   - Review and update `.claude/project-context.md` if needed
   - Check if any other documentation needs updates (PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md, etc.)

3. **Git Local Update:**
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - Suggest appropriate commit messages
   - Ask if I should create commits

4. **Git Remote Update:**
   - Check if commits need to be pushed
   - Offer to push to remote
   - Suggest creating PR if applicable

5. **Next Steps:**
   - What should be done in the next session
   - Any testing or deployment needed

Focus on resource optimization metrics and ensure all work is properly documented and saved.
